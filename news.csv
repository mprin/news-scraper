Saskatchewan Highways Minister Jeremy Cockrill said it’s important to work with its Prairie neighbours to ensure the safe, reliable, and sustainable movement of products to markets around the world.
“The world needs what Saskatchewan has to offer,” Cockrill said. “We rely on dependable, robust, road, rail, air and port networks to ship our food, fuel and fertilizer across North America and around the globe.”
Manitoba Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Doyle Piwniuk said his province’s unique gateway and hub initiatives cannot develop in isolation.
“That’s why external cooperative partnerships will leverage our initiatives for success,” Piwniuk said. “With similar trade and transport access such as distance to markets, reliance on international ports and railway services, and similar commodity basis, Saskatchewan and Alberta are natural key partners to work with on improving trade-enablement through transportation.”
Alberta’s Minister of Transportation and Economic Corridors Devin Dreeshen said he is proud to partner with Saskatchewan and Manitoba, taking a leadership role in building new trade corridors.
The memorandum commits the three provinces to improve efficiency of inter-provincial highway and rail networks, encourage the federal government for infrastructure funding and national supply chain solutions, grow capital investment, and harmonize regulations.

That’s according to a new report by the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) which claims by 2033 there will be a shortage of around 24,000 workers. This is because the average age of a Canadian farmer is around 56 years old.
Bob Reid, who farms in the Smeaton area, told paNOW finding younger people who want to be farmers becomes harder each and every year.
As to why, he believes many of today’s youth don’t have the work ethic.
“It’s too easy to get unemployment, it’s too easy to get benefits and sit and do nothing,” he said. “They’re not hungry, they have no ambition.” 
Because of this, Reid thinks these vacant positions will mostly be filled by foreign workers. 
This has already started on his farm as he’s had the same South African man on his payroll since late 2021. He said hiring him and helping his family legally move here was one of the best decisions he’s made as his work ethic is second to none. 
“When we’re rolling up a grain bag, he’s out of that truck and right there doing exactly what he’s supposed to do,” he said. 
The report also claimed around 40 per cent of farm operators will retire over the next ten years which will create one of the biggest leadership transitions in the country’s history.
It also stated around 66 per cent currently don’t have a succession plan in place.
“The bank wanted me to, but I said I wasn’t ready to face that yet,” added Reid who noted he keeps pushing the decision off as he doesn’t want someone to just sell his farmland.
Kerry Peterson, a Shellbrook area farmer, isn’t surprised to hear that many don’t know what they’re going to do with their land once they retire. He believes something you’ll see in around 10 years’ time are giant farms. 
“When a guy quits who doesn’t have someone to take over, it gets spread amongst the other farmers in the area,” he said. 
Peterson also mentioned foreign workers should help with the big labour shortage expected, but they most likely won’t be the answer when it comes to operators. He said this is because most people would be reluctant to give their farm to someone they’ve never met before and is just starting to make Canada their new home. 
Meanwhile, RBC’s report says foreign workers will only help in the short term. 
They believe the country needs to find a way to encourage more domestic workers to choose farming as a career which could include incentives and promoting agricultural education at different colleges and universities.

Canadian Agricultural Human Resources Council (CAHRC) is launching a survey to evaluate the post-pandemic labour market situation. 
CAHRC is a national, non-profit organization focused on addressing human resource issues facing agricultural businesses across Canada. The council works with industry leaders, governments, and educational stakeholders to research, develop and communicate solutions to the challenges in employment and skills development in primary agriculture.
Executive Director Jennifer Wright said the survey will serve as a reference point to the data that CAHRC has been gathering for almost a decade.
“The Canadian agriculture industry has been experiencing a growing labour shortage that is turning to a labour crisis. The update to this research will provide a measurement of what that labour shortage is currently and forecast what the future holds,” Wright said.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing issues, such as labour shortages and other challenges. Wright said it’s crucial to understand the current market situation and the impact of the pandemic on the industry’s workforce and better understand how workforce needs have changed so the agricultural industry can present the new research to policy makers to guide future action.
“This data is often used to inform policy, funding, training and education programs and labour market information assessments,” she said. “The more participation we have in this survey the better the data will be.”
Roughly 800 Canadian farm owner-operators, agricultural workers and supporting stakeholder groups will be surveyed and the input received will guide future action on labour shortages. These individuals and organizations will have until Apr. 30 to complete the survey.
The previous Labour Market Information (LMI) study was completed in 2018. This update will investigate opportunities and barriers to participation among groups in Canada’s population that have traditionally been under-represented in the agricultural workforce. This includes Indigenous peoples, new Canadians, women, youth and older workers. 
The industries in this study will also expand to include agriculture retail, cannabis production and organic production.
The council represents farming in all forms including traditional and non-traditional livestock; producing, cultivating, growing, harvesting, or collecting conventional and non-conventional agriculture commodities; and any practices performed as an integral part of an agricultural operation.

The report from the RBC, Boston Consulting Group Centre for Canada’s Future and Arrell Food Institute at the University of Guelph said the country will be short 24,000 general farm, nursery, and greenhouse operators.
It also estimated that 66 per cent of producers do not have a succession plan in place.
To address the shortage and lack of succession plans, the report said Canada will need to accept 30,000 permanent immigrants by 2033 to take over existing farms and greenhouses or establish their own.
It also recommended the country build a new pipeline of domestic operators and workers by bolstering agriculture education and increasing spending on automation, which can make existing farms more efficient.
The report added the shortage will come at a critical moment because Canada’s agricultural sector will need to produce significantly more food for a growing world population but must also cut emissions to meet climate targets.

Britain’s envoy to Canada said an uproar in the Prairies over an expanded trade deal could be overcome by ranchers rejigging their beef operations to meet U.K. standards.
In an interview, British High Commissioner to Canada Susannah Goshko said Brits don’t want their government to budge on barring imports of beef raised with certain hormones.
But groups like the Canadian Cattle Association said that concern isn’t based in science and that the U.K. is already exporting far more beef to Canada than trade in the other direction.
The industry wants Canada to block Britain’s entry to a massive Pacific Rim trade bloc and halt the ongoing negotiations for a separate U.K.-Canada trade deal until the Brits change their stance.
Goshko said the solution might be for Canadian ranchers to instead change their way of raising cows, as the Pacific Rim deal will allow vastly more quantities of Canadian beef to reach Britain.
She added the ongoing trade talks for a bilateral deal can give both countries an edge over the European Union, particularly in green tech and smaller businesses.

It’s used by the province and rural municipalities to reduce potential damage.
Highways minister Jeremy Cockrill said weight restrictions prevent damage to pavement and the ground underneath roads during spring thaw which reduces maintenance costs.
The road bans reduce allowable weights on rural municipal roads and secondary weight on provincial highways by 10 to 15 per cent and usually last about six weeks.
These road restrictions usually begin in March, but due to colder weather last month, restrictions were delayed.

Researchers at the University of Saskatchewan are looking for Saskatchewan farmers who have included a forage in either or both their 1991 to 1994 and 2016 to 2019 rotations. 
Even if farmers did not include a forage in the earlier period or if they do not believe their records are sufficient, they would still like to have input into their 2016 to 2019 production practices.
Through the survey, the researchers hope to be able to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how cattle producers have approached climate change mitigation, not only for research purposes, but for future policy development.
Producers will be compensated for their time.
The Forage Rotation Survey is available here.

The Saskatchewan Insect Research Facility (USIRF), located in the Agriculture Building on the USask Saskatoon campus, is a 500-square-foot site meets Canadian Food Inspection Agency Plant Protection Containment Level-2A requirements, allowing researchers to study non-native insects and pathogens that pose a potential threat to western Canadian crops. 
USask vice-president of research Dr. Baljit Singh said USIRF places the university in a unique position among research institutions in Canada.
“This facility, and the research it will lend itself to, is another example of how USask is leading in the areas of food security and agriculture. We are tackling important questions that will ultimately have an impact and better our communities,” he said.
USask entomologist and USIRF research lead Dr. Sean Prager said insects are an important part of agricultural ecosystems but some present huge economic and environmental risk.
“The USIRF provides us a space to pre-emptively study how these pests would work in our environment and with Saskatchewan crops before they become an issue,” Prager said. “This facility also allows us to involve students in this research, which means we can train students at the highest level of entomological research.”
The bio-secure insect-rearing and quarantine facility has mechanical and operating safeguards to prevent accidental release and cross-contamination of harmful species. The USIRF contains climate-controlled chambers for sustaining insects and infested plants, and space for conducting experiments. 
There will be collaborations between pest researchers and Crop Development Centre plant breeders. College of Agriculture and Bioresources Dean Dr. Angela Bedard-Haughn said researchers will be able to develop methods of managing insects, resulting in new ways to predict pest outbreaks, decrease pesticide use, and develop new pest-resistant crop varieties. 
“Our researchers will be able conduct the high-impact entomological research needed in Saskatchewan to develop more sustainable pest-management options and mitigate future risk,” Bedard-Haughn said. “These discoveries will have economic benefit for producers and help protect our agricultural ecosystems.” 
Funding for the USIRF comes from USask, the Western Grains Research Foundation, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission, Saskatchewan Pulse Growers, and the Saskatchewan Wheat Development Commission.

Cattle, bison, and sheep producers expressed common concerns from accessing capital, business risk management programs to getting financial credit for maintaining pastures that serve as carbon sinks for the environment. 
After a day of discussions, a representative from each sector made a closing comment. 
Willowbrook cattle producer Levi Hall is concerned for the future. He said with each cattle producers that exits the business there is an increase in grain and oilseed acres. 
“Fight for me to stay in the business because I love what I do. My mom and dad are at home feeding cows. They shouldn’t have to do it. But I’m here fighting for the industry,” he said.
Hall is also a director with the Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association.
Merrick Wigness is a bison producer from Cadillac, which is south of Swift Current. He wanted grazing groups to combine resources to clear up common misconceptions about the livestock industry.
“I kind of wonder if there’s an opportunity for some of the grazing animal associations to get together and create some sort of a pooled fund, and put that money towards a sophisticated public relations effort to try and fight back against the message that cattle are evil or their burps are going to destroy the world,” Wigness said. 
Gord Schrader with the Saskatchewan Sheep Development Board said accessing capital is extremely hard because sheep are perceived as a cottage industry.
“We have a lot of producers that have a few acres and have a few sheep. But, I’m not sure that you’re aware our industry has farms that are well over 1,000 ewes,” he said. 
The final comment was made by APAS president Ian Boxall, who grows grain, but does not have livestock. He said it’s clear there are a number of issues including intergenerational transfers and financing.
He said there is a need to ‘think outside the box’ when looking for ways to access money and to recognize the work that’s already being done for the environment.
“The Canadian government right now has an ad promoting grasslands and how great they are. That’s because of the work of the livestock industry,” he said.
Boxall urged the federal government to acknowledge the work of the livestock industry.
APAS will summarize and prioritize policy issues raised at the summit and develop proposals to present to the federal and provincial governments.

The Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) President Ian Boxall said the carbon tax increase has a significant impact on agriculture.
“These additional costs come off our bottom line because we’re price takers who sell into international markets,” Boxall said. “The impact of these costs on our farm operations needs to be recognized to ensure we can remain competitive in international markets. 
Boxall said Saskatchewan farms are going to pay over $40 million in carbon tax just to get their products to port. He said these farmers and ranchers are furthest from market access and bear significant costs from carbon surcharges on fuel to transport goods to market. 
On average, Saskatchewan grain production travels 1,150 miles to port. Published railway tariffs suggest a carbon surcharge of $0.1129 per railcar mile will be applied to rail shipments this year, which comes to over $36 million in carbon surcharges on 26 million tonnes of grain shipped to market access. 
Boxall said that the same disadvantage applies to livestock where the majority of cattle are shipped out of province due to the lack of federally inspected meat processing facilities in Saskatchewan. As an example, 800,000 calves travelling 600 kilometres from central Saskatchewan to feedlot alley in Alberta equals over 9,000 semi-loads of animals. Boxall said there are fuel carbon surcharges on travel both ways. 
“Farmers feel the impact of these costs in the prices they receive at the farmgate”, Boxall said. 
The Canadian Senate will also soon be reviewing Bill C-234 to exempt carbon charges on propane and natural gas for barn heating and grain drying. Boxall added this is a cost that producers see on their bills every month and there are no available fuel alternatives with current technology.
“Farmers will easily pay more in barn heating or grain drying each month than they will ever see in rebates”, he said. “We see these costs in our monthly bills and are feeling them trickle down to us through higher input costs and reduced commodity prices throughout the supply chain. We need policy measures to provide exemptions and relief programs that recognize the competitive impact these costs are having on our bottom lines.” 
On Mar. 20, Boxall spoke to the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food about the impacts of farm input inflation and the rising cost of food where he highlighted the importance of transparency throughout food supply chains. 
He said the current policy needs to be recognized and account for the impact of the carbon tax on the affordability of food in grocery stores and reduced farm margins.

For the first time in its 50-year history, Nutrien mined a production wing at its Lanigan location with no people present.
The Lanigan mine used cutting-edge tele-remote technology which allowed operators to use the mining machine from a remote location, removing them from the active mining area completely.
This enabled a step change in Nutrien’s operating strategies.
The potash industry has seen some serious injuries when operators are working on an active mining face. The tele-remote technology is seen as an innovative solution to help improve operational and safety processes in underground mining.
Nutrien operates six potash mines in Saskatchewan.

Some southern Saskatchewan municipalities have re-introduced a $20 bounty for coyotes.
Rural Municipality of Weyburn Reeve Norm McFadden said families are concerned after seeing packs of up to 15 coyotes in the area.
The Saskatchewan government introduced a $20 coyote bounty in 2009, but it wasn’t renewed in 2010, the same year the province introduced a compensation program for producers who lose livestock to predators.
McFadden said 95 per cent of the feedback has been positive, and he said the program is expected to run until late fall.

The event will take place at the Meadow Lake Library in the back room from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on April 27.
There is a nominal cost of about $20 to lease a garden plot, which helps recover some of the cost of the water delivery and tillage.
Willow Creek Community Garden coordinator Pat Morley said the fee also enables people to attend the year-round garden club’s seminars, workshops, tours, and social events.
“We try to make it a learning experience,” she said. “We want to encourage people to come out and learn how to garden and produce fresh fruit and vegetables. The biggest thing is to get people involved, outside, get fresh air and sunshine, and have a place to be able to do that.”
The community garden is located between Seventh Avenue East and Ninth Avenue East, running along Sixth Street East, in Meadow Lake. The garden has 34 20 sq. ft. ground plots available.
“We divide them up,” Morley said. “Some people don’t want a full plot. We try to accommodate as many [people] as we can.”
The volunteer group also has seven plots with extra-high raised garden beds, to make it easier for people who have a hard time bending down to garden.
“We’re building more this spring, as soon as the weather permits,” Morley said. “We’re hoping to get another four.”
There are also seven medium-high raised bed gardens and three smaller-sized medium-high raised beds.
The community garden also contains a communal garden space for people to use who do volunteer work at the garden.
“That is [for] our fruit trees, our sorrel, our rhubarb, our strawberry boxes and our herbs, and bedding plants that get donated… We put them in spots that are for everybody to use,” Morley said.
She noted the community garden is not for people who walk in off the street to access and help themselves to the produce. People must be registered members or volunteers to use the garden.
The garden’s growing season runs from May to the end of September.
Morley said for people who don’t have a garden of their own at home, the community garden fills a need.
“[Some people] don’t have any place to plant anything,” she said. “So, it’s important to get people out and have a place to be able to get together, grow some fresh produce, build community, and be a part of a community project that does something good for the whole community.”

Bill C-234, the private member’s bill that would remove the federal carbon tax from natural gas and propane used on farms, received third reading yesterday.
The bill passed with a 176 to 146 vote, as Conservative, New Democrat, Bloc Quebecois, and Green Party MPs voted in favour. Three Liberals MPs supported the bill.
It was introduced in February 2022 in the House of Commons by Conservative Member of Parliament Ben Lobb. It amended the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act to address the strain placed on farmers who have no other option to dry their grain, heat their barns, or run their operations. The exemption would not apply to off-farm grain drying.
Conservative Shadow Minister for Agriculture and Agri-Food John Barlow said it was a huge win for Canadian farmers.
“This exemption is needed to reflect the realities of the entire Canadian agriculture industry and the undue financial burden the carbon tax places on all the necessary practices undertaken by farmers and ranchers like drying grain, irrigating crops, or heating and cooling livestock barns,” Barlow said. 
Barlow said the Conservatives will continue to champion agriculture in Canada and fight the Liberal carbon tax to ensure farm families are environmentally and economically sustainable.
“Conservatives recognize for generations farmers have a record of being environmental stewards and innovators, adopting the latest technologies and sustainability practices,” Barlow said. 
The Agriculture Carbon Alliance (ACA) was pleased with the passage of Bill C-234 through the House of Commons. 
Co-Chair Dave Carey said his group is now calling on all Senators to show their support for farmers by ensuring Bill C-234’s passage into law. 
He said the proposed legislation will deliver critical financial relief for farmers, growers and ranchers across the agricultural sector. 
“As Canadian farmers face rising production costs, the passage of Bill C-234 is crucial to providing much-needed financial support,” Carey said. “This legislation will provide farmers with the resources to invest in innovative and sustainable on-farm practices, while ensuring the stability of our food supply.”
Carey urged the Senate to take swift and decisive action on the bill.

This will come as excellent news for Saskatchewan producers, according to Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association CEO Grant McLellan — especially since Japan is the third-biggest beef importer in the world.
“We feel very good about it. I mean, this is 20 years in the making that we finally get to see the final vestiges of some of those restrictions and trade blockages from Canada to Japan,” he said.
“We’ve seen even in the face of those challenges that Japan is our second-largest export market for Canadian beef. I know that we exported — I think in 2022 — $520 million in beef products, which even that was an 18 per cent increase over the previous year and 2021. So it’s definitely huge news, very welcome news.”
Japan first restricted Canadian beef in 2003 after cattle on an Alberta farm tested positive for mad cow disease.
“Saskatchewan is the second-largest meat producer in Canada,” McLellan said. “So the implications on the Canadian beef sector can just be kind of extrapolated out that they are damaging in any case when we lose market access for a product that we produce here in Saskatchewan.
“And so the implications are significant. When you talk about an industry that certainly is facing its challenges, access to more markets — and in particular — high-value markets like Japan can only be beneficial to our producers here in Saskatchewan.”
“Cattle theft is a bit of an interesting situation that we deal with here,” McLellan said. “We know that numbers of missing cattle are reported higher typically around the fall when animals are coming back from pasture and to get a real grasp on the count as they move animals back to the home yard and things like that.”
McLellan said cattle theft isn’t necessarily a major issue in the province. It comes and goes following the general ebbs and flows of the economy.
“Obviously, when things are tough, you see missing cattle numbers reported going up,” he said. “And when things are good, you don’t see it as much and that kind of comes down to crimes of opportunity, crimes of need. People might be looking to put some meat in their freezer. But is this an issue that is pervasive all the time? I wouldn’t say so.”
Speaking on the recent cattle theft in which a 48-year-old man was arrested, McLellan said things like that were an anomaly.
“We don’t really see those kinds of large-scale numbers, at least here in Saskatchewan,” he said.
McLellan said that good branding of animals, fencing and infrastructure are solid ways to prevent cattle from wandering off or getting stolen.

Minister Responsible Doyle Piwniuk said the announcement included $74 million for the development of a northern corridor through the Port of Churchill for the export of resources and nearly $250 million to improve five existing roadways to improve safety and year-round connectivity between northern communities.
“We understand the importance of improving transportation linkages today to transport goods and services, promote tourism, mining exploration and spur economic development,” Piwniuk said. “We are also committing to a bright future by making the Port of Churchill an inter-continental trade gateway.” 
Piwniuk said $75 million will be used to improve seven northern airports which includes new airport terminal buildings, improvements to exiting terminals, and runway repairs.
There will be $98.3 million spent on Provincial Road 283 for a new bridge at the Pasquia River and bituminous reconstruction from the Saskatchewan boundary to PTH 10 at The Pas. Once complete, this section will support Manitoba’s heaviest allowable loads and will complete 39.7 km of the trade and commerce grid.

A new national program for Canadian soybean growers, grain handlers and exporters has been created to meet the needs of customers and ensure continued access to premium markets. 
The new Sustainable Canadian Soy program was developed by Soy Canada.
Executive Director Brian Innes said this happened with extensive farmer and industry consultation and is funded in part through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership’s AgriAssurance Program.
“Customers have been asking for a verifiable sustainable program,” Innes said. “Sustainable Canadian Soy is a market-driven solution that will enable our industry to compete for market share and enhance the sustainability of Canadian farms and the entire soybean value chain.” 
Sustainable Canadian Soy utilizes the Farm Sustainability Assessment (FSA), a globally recognized whole farm sustainability benchmarking and assessment program, that focuses on meeting customer needs and values. 
The FSA aligns with Sustainable Canadian Soy priorities, including land use efficiency, climate-smart farming, soil health, water stewardship, biodiversity and habitat. 
Grower participation in the program is voluntary and includes completing an on-farm sustainability questionnaire about economic viability, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship. 
The Sustainable Canadian Soy Program will be available for the 2023 growing season.

To mark National Grain Week, the Grain Growers of Canada (GGC) urged all political parties to support Bill C-234, an amendment to the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act. 
GGC chair Andre Harpe said the amendment would extend the exemption for qualifying farming fuel to natural gas and propane.
“By extending the exemption this amendment will unlock innovation and drive sustainable growth in the sector,” Harpe said. “We urge all political parties to support this important legislation and demonstrate their commitment to the needs of Canadian farmers.”
Farmers incur a carbon price when using natural gas and propane for practices like grain drying, land irrigation, and heating or cooling their barns. 
Harpe said Bill C-234 will allow farmers to invest in new efficiencies that reduce fuel usage by putting money back in their hands.
“Unlocking innovation is key to achieving sustainability in agriculture. Carbon surcharges on necessary farm activities only add to the financial strain and divert capital away from critical investments,” he said.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency will receive $57.5 million over five years to set up a FMD vaccine bank and develop response plans if the disease makes its way to Canada. The federal government will ask the provinces and territories to share the cost. 
The Canadian cattle sector has been asking for a vaccine bank. Canadian Cattle Association President Nathan Phinney said with the threat of FMD the bank helps provide insurance to protect Canada’s export markets. 
“While we hope this vaccine bank is never needed, we are grateful for today’s investment and its establishment,” Phinney said. “We appreciate the government listening to our concerns and understanding the critical need to put in place emergency preparedness plans to control the spread of the disease and protect our export markets for Canadian beef.”
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) will get $13 million to implement an increase to the interest-free limit under the Advance Payments Program from $250,000 to $350,000 for the 2023 program year.
There will be more funding for eastern Canadian farmers who rely on fertilizer largely imported from Russia. These producers will be eligible for $34.1 million over three years through the On-Farm Climate Action Fund to support nitrogen management practices. Canadian Federation of Agriculture President Keith Currie said his group would like to see some kind of incentive to get fertilizer produced in Eastern Canada.
The federal budget also includes $333 million over 10 years for the Dairy Innovation and Investment Fund. Administered by AAFC, it will be used to support investments in research and development of new products that use solids non-fat (SNF) which is a byproduct of dairy processing, market development for these products, and processing capacity for SNF-based products more broadly.
The federal government has promised to make amendments to the Canada Transportation Act for a temporary extension, on a pilot basis, of the interswitching limit in the prairie provinces to strengthen rail competition.
There is also a commitment to begin consultations this summer on the right to repair and interoperability of farming equipment, which is being welcomed by the Agricultural Manufacturers of Canada.
The Trudeau government announced $43 billion in new spending over six years with a $40 billion deficit expected for the 2023-24 fiscal year which is up from the $30 billion projected last fall.

The grants will support programs in Alberta’s agriculture and agri-food sector.
Alberta Agriculture and Irrigation Minister Nate Horner said the province’s programs will create new jobs and spur growth in the sector by supporting value-added processing, attracting new investment, and expanding irrigation capacity.
“The new Sustainable CAP provides flexibility to deliver programs that will help producers grow their business and improve productivity while addressing the unique challenges of farming in Alberta,” Horner said in a news release. “Alberta’s producers are among the best in the world when it comes to sustainable practices, and we will continue to support their efforts to feed the world while protecting the environment for generations to come.”
Horner said the programs will also continue to protect plant and animal health and animal welfare, manage risks to Alberta’s natural resources, and invest in producer-led agriculture research. 
Producers also have access to an enhanced suite of business risk management programs to help them manage risks that threaten the viability of their farms and are beyond their capacity to manage.
Sustainable CAP is a five-year, $3.5-billion investment by Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial governments. 
This includes $1 billion in federal programs and activities and a $2.5 billion commitment that is cost-shared 60 per cent federally and 40 per cent provincially/territorially for programs that are designed and delivered by provinces and territories.
This is a $500 million increase in cost-shared funding with half of the additional funding going to the development and implementation of the Resilient Agricultural Landscape Program that supports carbon sequestration, and protect grasslands and wetlands on agricultural lands.
Sustainable CAP comes into effect April 1 and replaces the Canadian Agricultural Partnership.

For the first time in two decades, Canadian processed beef will be welcome in Japan.
Canada will have full access to the Japanese market for the first time since 2003 when that country put restrictions on Canadian beef after the discovery of a case of mad cow disease in Alberta.
Japan previously loosened some restrictions in 2019, when it OK’ed imports of Canadian beef from cattle older than 30 months.
“Cattle producers are grateful for the removal of trade barriers for processed beef in Japan, our second-largest export market for beef,” Nathan Phinney, the president of the Canadian Cattle Association, said in a media release.
“Our industry will continue to support global food security by providing some of the most sustainable and highest-quality beef in the world. We look forward to continuing to work with the Government of Canada to further remove remaining trade barriers and expanding our trade capacity in the Indo-Pacific region.”
According to the federal government, the new Indo-Pacific Strategy will see Canada try to strengthen regional partnerships in hopes of expanding economic opportunities.
Under that plan, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, with the support of Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, has been trying to create what the government called “the highest production standards and quality assurance of Canadian beef” to get back into markets like Japan.
The government said the Japanese market for Canadian beef and beef products had an estimated value of $518 million in 2022.
“The Canadian Meat Council is very pleased to see this expansion of our beef access to Japan,” Christopher White, the president and CEO of the Canadian Meat Council, said in the release. “Our members view this as a critical market for their products, including processed beef and beef patties.”
Under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, Japan’s 38.5 per cent tariff on beef imports (including things like ground beef patties) will decrease to 23.35 per cent on Saturday, and will fall to nine per cent by 2033.
Tariffs on other processed beef products will be reduced even more or, in some cases, eliminated completely.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has revoked a primary control zone for the highly contagious avian flu in B.C.
This happens when post-outbreak surveillance is completed, and no further cases of avian influenza are detected.
The agency’s website showed the number of birds that have been impacted in the province was 3,657,000.
CFIA said that while the virus affects birds, there is no evidence it can be passed to humans who consume poultry products.

Farmers in the Cowichan Valley said they are losing crops and dealing with property and field damage caused by Roosevelt Elk.
The threatened species typically moves to lower elevations during the winter months searching for more plentiful food, but in the last few years, some herds have been staying on farmland in the Duncan area year-round.
A University of Alberta research project intended to reduce human-elk conflict in the Cowichan Valley started in August 2021 and aims to test deterrents to keep elk out of farms.
Researchers said they hope to share their work with farmers and the provincial government to help with the management of Roosevelt Elk.

A dramatic uptick in pet ownership during the COVID-19 pandemic and demand for a large animal specialists has led to an urgent shortage of veterinary professionals not only in Western Canada, but across North America.
The B.C. government is doubling the number of subsidized seats for B.C. veterinary students at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) at the University of Saskatchewan (USask).
B.C. Minister of Post-Secondary Education and Future Skills Selina Robinson said there was a need to increase support to WCVM.
“Veterinarians play a critical role in supporting the agricultural sector, people, and the health and welfare of animals across B.C.,” Robinson said. “Last year, we doubled the number of B.C. students funded to study veterinary medicine and now we are committing to continue this funding so more people receive quality training, and our pets and farm animals can get the health care they need.”
B.C. Minister of Agriculture and Food Pam Alexis the services and care vets provide B.C. farmers supports food security and results in British Columbians enjoying the benefits of a healthy and stable farming community.
“It’s clear we need more veterinarians in our communities, so our pets and livestock receive the attention they need, when they need it, and our government continues to take action on both recruitment and training to make that happen,” Alexis said.
WCVM Dean Dr. Gillian Muir said B.C.’s decision to maintain increased funding of the WCVM is a critical step toward addressing the shortage of veterinarians.
“This commitment also allows B.C. and the WCVM to work together to target priorities for British Columbians, including training more veterinarians who want to practice in rural communities and attracting more Indigenous students to the profession,” Muir said.
In September, Saskatchewan and Manitoba announced increased funding for the WCVM. Each province boosted its student seat quota by five. Saskatchewan now has 25 seats in the college’s first-year class while Manitoba has 20 students. One seat is annually allocated to a student from Canada’s northern territories, while two seats are designated for Indigenous applicants. WCVM will now have a total of 88 students in the first-year class.
B.C.’s contribution is $21.8 million over three years. The government of Alberta supports students attending the Veterinary College at the University of Calgary.

The event will take place from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. May 11 at the AgriPlex and AgriVilla buildings, at the exhibition grounds in North Battleford.  
Battlefords Agricultural Society general manager Jocelyn Ritchie said this is the first time the organization has held the event since before the pandemic situation, so she was looking forward to offering it again. 
“It’s a good program for the school kids,” she said. “They learn about all kinds of safety – from farm safety, water safety, ATV safety, chemical safety – all kinds of  different safety aspects.”
The organizers will also have an information booth set up focusing on mental health this year. 
“We usually try to mix it up. Every year we have different things that they learn about,” Ritchie said. “We will have it in two buildings. In the morning they will go through the stations in one building.”
After that, kids will enjoy a free lunch. Then, in the afternoon the groups switch buildings they are visiting, as they continue the educational sessions.
About 600 school children in Grades 1-6 from the Battlefords and surrounding area are already pre-registered to take part in the event this year. About 150 chaperones and volunteers will also participate in this free program.
Leading into spring, Ritchie said, it’s always important to offer these types of farm safety events.
“You wouldn’t believe what the kids learn, and actually take back to their parents. We had some really good discussions and comments from parents as well as teachers after our program,” she said.
Ritchie added many kids from the Battlefords don’t have any experience in rural living, and need to learn to take precautions, to avoid potentially dangerous situations. 
The ag safety event also includes a session on being safe around rural animals, as well as how to look out for blind spots around farm equipment. 
“It’s very educational for everybody,” Ritchie said.
The agricultural society volunteers and experts will provide presentations and demonstrations throughout the day.
The program is funded in part through the provincial association— the Saskatchewan Association of Agricultural Societies and Exhibitions, as well as partly through community sponsorships.

Egg Farmers of Canada are marking its 50th anniversary with a commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Egg Farmers chair Roger Pelissero said this is the next step in the Canadian egg farming industry’s sustainability journey. 
“Stepping up our commitment to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions is a natural extension of our already established holistic approach to sustainability, an approach that continues to guide our actions today and into the future,” Pelissero said. “A net-zero goal naturally builds on these efforts and further entrenches our commitment towards the environment in the core of our farming operations.”
Pelissero said Canadian egg farmers have a longstanding track-record of supporting sustainable initiatives and programs, including a science-based research program, farm level decision-making tools, and environmental technologies which has led to efficiencies and productivity gains within the egg farming sector, allowing farmers to produce more eggs while using fewer resources. 
The announcement was made during an event that marked the anniversary of Egg Farmers of Canada and egg supply management.

The government has set a target of 30 per cent from 2020 levels by 2030.
Consultations were held to gather feedback on how best to support farmers and producers through voluntary measures.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said over 2,000 submissions were received through the online consultation, technical workshops and town hall meetings between March and October 2022.
Farmers, producers, industry associations, provinces and territories, scientists and environmental organizations provided their input. Based on this information, AAFC published the ‘What We Heard Report.’
Bibeau said the federal government’s goal is to invest in practices that are effective in reducing emissions and regenerating soil.
“I want to thank everyone who participated in the consultation process. Your feedback will contribute to how we reach our ambitious target and ensure the sector’s success,” Bibeau said.
Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) President Keith Currie said there is a diversity of perspectives on many key issues. He said he was pleased to see the report identify the importance of further producer engagement.
“We are pleased to see the report highlight the key themes we continue to explore in the context of the Sustainable Agriculture Strategy such as the importance of data capturing regional variation and accurately depicting on-farm emissions, and the need for incentives to effectively support adoption of best practices,” Currie said. “Most importantly, we are pleased to see the report factor in producer profitability.”
Fertilizer Canada President & CEO Karen Proud said she was happy to see universal support of 4R Nutrient Stewardship.
“We look forward to continuing to work with the government and producers to improve measurement and accelerate the adoption of 4R Best Management Practices, which reduce emissions and increases productivity,” Proud said.
A Fertilizer Working Group has being formed and will work with industry and government to share information, identify resources to reduce emissions from fertilizers, and improve the measurement and tracking of fertilizer emissions

Agriculture in the Classroom Canada (AITC-C) is rolling out its new digital agriculture awareness campaign.
AITC-C Acting Executive Director Sara Shymko said helping students discover their passion for agriculture and empowers them to explore career paths in the industry and the use of technology and digital platforms is critical.
The federal government will provide roughly $953,000 over two years.
Funding will be for the new I Am Agriculture digital campaign. The new website page, videos, and social campaign will showcase the agriculture industry, and help students identify the different and unique roles they play as well as increasing student knowledge of agricultural practices.
The second year of The Great Canadian Farm Tour will also receive funding. AITC-C will bring Canadian classrooms virtually into farms from coast to coast, starting in April and lasting six weeks. The farm tours will start conversations between students and farmers to build trust and understanding around where their food comes from.
Shymko said the the collaboration with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been critical in supporting their goal to inspire students.
“With this generous contribution from the AgriCommunication Program, AITC-C can bring this messaging into a farther-reaching, digital space,” Shymko said. “With 1 in 9 jobs in Canada in the agriculture and agri-food sector and a growing labour shortage, it’s critical that the next generation of our work force consider agriculture as a viable, exciting and meaningful career path.”

There is no question that agriculture is a key component of Saskatchewan’s economy.
Agriculture spending announced in today’s provincial budget for 2023 is $548.2 million, which is a 19 per cent increase from the previous year.
Agriculture Minister David Marit said the industry is well-positioned to continue to take on the challenges inherent to agriculture and build on its success.
“This budget will help Saskatchewan’s farmers, ranchers and agri-business remain competitive and operate sustainably while continuing to deliver safe, high-quality food,” Marit said.
There is $408 million to fund a suite of federal-provincial risk management programs including Crop Insurance and AgriStability.
Average Crop Insurance coverage for 2023 is at a record-high level of $446 per acre ,due to increased commodity prices and yield coverage.
The AgriStability compensation rate will increase from 70 to 80 per cent for the 2023 program year, to better support farmers in times of need.
Included in the agriculture portion of the budget is $89.8 million for initiatives under the federal-provincial Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership.
Marit said there are some new PST exemptions for vegetable and wild rice producers.
“The rice growers in the northern part of the province, for their boats and equipment, that will be PST exempt. We also heard from the produce sector out in the irrigation district about PST exemption on storage buildings as well,” Marit said. “Those we heard very clear from our stakeholders that was obviously a cost to them.”
The Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association (SCA) applauded the increase in funding for research and the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership.
CEO Grant McLellan said SCA appreciates the commitment to fiscal restraint and a balanced budget.
“When you look at the increases to programs like Farm Ranch Water Infrastructore Program already announced, and no new taxes, this budget does a good job of providing reliable support for our livestock sector,” McLellan said.
The budget provides increased support for producers to develop sustainable agriculture water sources like wells, dugouts and pipelines, as well as increased funding for irrigation programming.
The budget includes $1 million to target invasive weed control on agricultural Crown land pastures and more than $38 million for agricultural research.
The total Municipal Revenue sharing pool was increased from just over $262 million in 2022/23 to $297.9 million in this budget.
The Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) was pleased with that news.
SARM President Ray Orb said RMs play an important role in the provincial economy.
“More funding is needed so RMs can continue to provide a level of service expected by sectors driving Saskatchewan’s economy including preparing for future growth in the critical minerals sector,” Orb said. “We are hopeful more can be allocated in the near future.”
Orb said SARM appreciates the $412.7 million for the SaskTel 5G and rural fibre network but more needs to be done to reach the goal of broadband infrastructure parity for all Saskatchewan residents regardless of where they live.

The couple have roughly 400 bison cow-calf pairs and feed to the finishing stage about 800 animals annually that are shipped to the United States because processing capacity in Canada is limited. Some of the bison meat is then imported back to Canada and sold as Noble Premium Bison.
Johnson says producers have much to learn from the bison.
“The Northern Great Plains exist today because of the bison. They formed the eco-system through the grazing and their hoof action as the keystone species,” Johnson said. “We keep hearing that we need to graze (cattle) the way the bison do. Why re-invent the wheel? Let them work for us instead of us working for them.”
Johnson said he sees value in participating in setting the direction of important research.
“It’s really important as an agricultural producer to be part of the conversation whether it’s research or policy. If you don’t get involved, you are on the outside looking in,” Johnson said. “You are not at the table; you are ‘on the menu.’”
Johnson started his second three-year term on Mar.1. The chair position is a one-year commitment.
As the newly elected chair of the board, Johnson said he is looking forward to being a part of crafting the strategic vision of the board.
“It’s really encouraging to see the people who were on the board for the first couple of terms and they developed a real identity for the board. Now, we have new people coming in with new ideas. They are experienced whether it’s in governance or hands-on. We’ve got a really good group,” Johnson said.
The dean of the Western College of Veterinary Medicine Dr. Gillian Muir and Dr. Angela Bedard-Haugh, dean of the College of Agriculture and Bioresources as well as LFCE director Dr. Scott Wright are also involved.
At their Mar. 1 meeting, the advisory board members welcomed three new people who will serve a three-year term.
Calvin Gavelin and his wife operate a mixed farm/ranch with Red Angus cattle near McCord, Sask. In addition to running the cow-calf operation, they background and finish their cattle to supply a farmgate, direct-market beef business. Four years ago, they completed a Holistic Management Course where they learned how to implement regenerative agriculture principles. He has served on many industry boards and was the reeve of the Rural Municipality of Mankota. Gavelin is currently a director-at-large with Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association.
Kyron Manske and his wife own and operate East Poplar Simmentals, a purebred and commercial cow-calf operation near Coronach, Sask. He earned his Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness from USask and is a board member of the Saskatchewan Simmental Association, Saskatchewan Stockgrowers Association and South Saskatchewan Ready, as well as a councillor with the Rural Municipality of Hart Butte.
Dr. Leigh Rosengren and her husband farm near Midale, Sask. She earned a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the Western College of Veterinary Medicine and a PhD in Veterinary Epidemiology from USask in the early 2000s. More recently, Rosengren completed a Masters of Agribusiness from Kansas State University, which was instrumental in improving the management systems of their grain farm and influential on the decision to disperse the cow-calf herd to consider other opportunities in the sector. Rosengren continues to work in the livestock industry as chief veterinary officer with the Canadian Cattle Association and as an epidemiology consultant.
Stepping down from the board after serving the maximum of two terms are Duane Thompson, Tamara Carter, and Neil Block. All three have served since the board was established in March 2018. Carter will continue as an ex-officio member for the next year, providing support to Johnson.
The Livestock and Forage Centre of Excellence is a research facility with a 1,500-head cattle feedlot and a 400-head cowherd, and two bison herds.

The two new locations are Dunmore and Saskatoon.
UFA also announced it has opened its doors in Weyburn and Yorkton. The sites are part of the expansion of UFA’s petroleum business in central and eastern Saskatchewan.
UFA also announced a historic patronage dividend of $28 million back to its membership. This marks the sixth consecutive year of increased patronage and a 56 per cent increase over last year.
President and CEO Scott Bolton said one of the primary benefits to being a co-operative member is patronage.
“This year’s patronage dividend is truly significant,” Bolton said. “We have expanded our patronage program to reward our membership by paying on more categories of purchases. More products our members use daily on their farm, ranch, or for their business now earn them patronage rewards. We are proud to grow and deliver patronage consistently.”
UFA reported a good fiscal year. In addition to the patronage dividend, it reported $2.4 billion in financial revenues and $157 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.

McCain Foods said it will spend $600 million to double the size of its potato processing facility in southern Alberta.
The Toronto-based food manufacturing company said the project at its Coaldale location will be the largest investment in the company’s history.
The project will create two new production lines as well as 260 new jobs, more than doubling the facility’s current workforce.
McCain said the expansion will also include wind turbines and solar panels to provide 100 per cent renewable electricity to the facility. Renewable biogas generated at the site’s wastewater treatment facility will offset natural gas demand.
McCain said construction on the expansion will begin later this year.

Statistics Canada reported the Consumer Price Index for Food was up 10.6 per cent year-over-year in February. That was the seventh straight month with a double-digit increase.
Supply constraints, unfavourable weather in growing regions and higher input costs for energy, packaging materials and animal feeds were responsible.
The greatest increases in food cost were for fruit juices which were up 15.7 per cent, cereal products 14.8 per cent, vegetables 13.0 per cent, dairy products 9.4 per cent and meat up 6.2 per cent.
Making sure that expensive food doesn’t go to waste was discussed at yesterday’s Commons Agriculture Committee meeting yesterday.
Nearly 60 per cent of food produced in Canada, or 35.5 million tonnes, is lost and wasted annually. Roughly 11.2 million tonnes of that food is edible and could be redirected to people in need. The financial value of this rescuable lost and wasted food worth $49.46 billion.
The non-profit food rescue organization has a mission to redistribute surplus food.
Second Harvest CEO Lori Nikkel told the committee “Best Before Date” labels should be eliminated from food sold in grocery stores and supermarkets.
“Best before dates are wildly, wildly misunderstood,” Nikkel said. “They are not expiry dates, they refer to a product’s peak freshness so while Canadians struggle to put food on the table, they’re also convinced that best before dates are about safety and will throw away perfectly good food to protect themselves or their families.”
Nikkel said eliminating best before dates would prevent safe consumable food from being thrown out saving Canadians money on their grocery bills.
“While the issues of food affordability and growing food insecurity are complex and require long term solutions to resolve, there is more that we can do right now to ensure that millions of vulnerable Canadians are not going hungry,” she said.
Nikkel is also called on the federal government to bring back the emergency food security fund which will implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eight skunks found dead last month in Vancouver and nearby Richmond, B.C., tested positive for avian flu.
British Columbia’s Ministry of Agriculture said the skunks were infected with the same H5N1 strain that has caused the deaths of millions of domestic poultry since the outbreak began in April last year.
The skunks were found in residential areas in both cities and were taken to B.C.’s Animal Health Centre over concerns they may have been deliberately poisoned.
The ministry said in a statement the skunks may have contracted H5N1 by scavenging on infected wild birds.
While avian flu in skunks is a low risk to human health; there are always risks when people or pets come into contact with sick or dead wild animals.
Since last April, wildlife infected by avian flu included more than 20 species of wild birds, two skunks and a fox found in rural areas of the province.

Dairy Farmers of Canada (DFC) have released its strategy to reduce emissions.
The Net Zero by 2050 Best Management Practices Guide will help Canadian dairy farmers contribute to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, a goal set by DFC last year.
Dairy Farmers of Canada president Pierre Lampron said working toward the target confirms the dairy sector is part of the effort to tackle climate change and ensures consumers can continue to enjoy dairy products made with 100 per cent Canadian milk for years to come.
Lampron said while net zero is an important commitment, generations of Canadian dairy farmers have already shown their commitment to new practices.
“The leadership of Canadian dairy farmers in sustainability is bearing fruit. For instance, the carbon footprint of our dairy production is one of the lowest in the world,” Lampron said.
DFC’s Best Practices Guide has been developed in consultation with experts to help farmers identify and implement best management practices (BMPs) on their farm, including an overview of 30 BMP opportunities for reducing emissions, increasing carbon sequestration, and improving overall environmental sustainability.

Maple Leaf Foods raised its dividend as it reported a loss of $41.5 million in its latest quarter due in part to weaker pork markets and a cyber attack.
The food processing company said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of 21 cents per share, up from 20 cents per share.
The increased payment to shareholders came as Maple Leaf said its loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 amounted to 34 cents per share compared with a profit of $1.9 million or two cents per share in the last three months of 2021.
Sales totalled $1.19 billion, up from $1.12 billion a year earlier.
The company said its most recent quarter included a $23 million hit related to what it called a cybersecurity incident in November and $25.8 million in startup expenses related to construction projects.
On an adjusted basis, Maple Leaf said it lost 28 cents per share in its fourth quarter compared with an adjusted profit of nine cents per share a year earlier.

They’re destroying livestock food resources and crops.
The issue was brought up at the annual Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) convention in Saskatoon last week, and several farmers wanted to know what the province planned to do about it.
RM of Val Marie Reeve Larry Grant addressed both Premier Scott Moe and Environment Minister Dana Skoropad during the “Bear Pit” question-and-answer period.
He told both of them that the western side of the province had been in drought for a long time and growing feed was impossible for many farmers.
“One thing that has grown is the deer and elk population. They’re decimating feed stacks. In my area, hay — if you can get it — is $200 a bale, delivered. The deer are moving in and taking their share first and what’s left they urinate on and defecate on, and destroy it,” he said.
Grant said the action was needed immediately to control the deer and elk populations.
That sentiment was echoed by RM of Insinger Coun. Dwayne Kitzan. The RM is northwest of Yorkton.
“This is a big problem and it’s growing,” he said. “It’s not only the feed and the damage that they do, but it’s … the wolves that are moving in, the coyotes, the ravens and the magpies, and they’re doing a lot of damage also.”
SARM president Ray Orb said 2023 was a “worst-case scenario” year, not just limited to the wintertime.
“We had an early snow. We had a lot of ice with the snow,” he said. “The wildlife are really in trouble, so we need to figure out something.”
Orb explained that not only had farmers met with provincial representatives but resolutions had also been passed by SARM delegates, calling for depredation tags to be issued, something that would help in the short term.
“In the long term, I think we have to have a better management plan for wildlife. It is also increasing limits … because they’re on the draw system. They need to have open season for some places like a regular season so that they’re better controlled,” added Orb.
In the past, Orb mentioned the province had set up feeding stations, especially for elk, to get them away from farmers’ fields and yards.
While Moe and Skoropad didn’t mention that, they did say that depredation tags could be issued. Those are permits that allow farmers to shoot certain wildlife on their property to protect their crops and livestock.
“I definitely hear what your concern is,” said Skoropad. “We’re going to be looking at offering more tags to address the population.”
“I’m going to ask … our minister of environment to engage with (Orb) and his team on the potential of some depredation tags being made available to SARM,” said Moe.
Grant said if something wasn’t done immediately, there could be disastrous consequences.
“It’s in dire straits. The livestock industry has dealt with drought and feed shortages, and we’re not going to have a livestock industry if something isn’t done,” said Grant.
A request for an interview has been sent to the Ministry of Environment for comment on issuing special hunting tags or other potential solutions to farmers’ concerns.

On Monday, the governments announced $485 million for what is called “strategic agricultural initiatives” in the province under a new five-year Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP).
“Through the Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership, we are investing in the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the agriculture sector, while ensuring the resilience of supply chains,” Gudie Hutchings, the federal minister of rural economic development, said in a media release.
“These programs and initiatives will create new ways for producers in Saskatchewan and processors to continue to improve their competitiveness while protecting our environment.”
“The Sustainable Canadian Agricultural Partnership will help build on the great work already happening in the agriculture industry in Saskatchewan,” Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit added. “This investment will see enhancements to existing programs and the introduction of new programs to position us to continue on our sustainability journey, while ensuring the sector continues to grow, prosper, and remain competitive.”
The Sustainable CAP is a five-year $3.5-billion investment by the federal and provincial governments. It includes $1 billion in federal programs and activities and $2.5 billion in cost-shared programs and activities by the two levels of government.
The program includes $89.4 million annually in strategic programming for Saskatchewan farmers, ranchers and agri-businesses, up from $71.2 million in the previous federal-provincial partnership.
“Under the new agreement, there is a continued focus on agricultural research and increased support for water development, with an increased funding cap in the Farm and Ranch Water Infrastructure Program and a larger per-acre payment under the Irrigation Development Program,” the release said.
Under the deal: $176.6 million will be invested to build capacity in the agriculture sector; $53.4 million will go to support the long-term resiliency and sustainability of the sector; $40.2 million will go to support the sustainability of the sector by anticipating, mitigating and responding to risks while building public trust; $2 million will be invested to help the industry expand domestic and international trade opportunities; and, $175 million will be invested in research and development.
As well, $37.8 million will be used to support programs delivered by the federal government, including AgriMarketing and AgriAssurance.
There also will be offerings of more business risk management (BRM) programs to help producers manage risks that threaten the viability of their farms.
The Sustainable CAP is to go into effect on April 1.

The company’s takeover of Kansas City Southern Railway has now been approved by the Surface Transportation Board in the U.S., meaning the two will merge and become known as Canadian Pacific Kansas City.
It would create the only single-line rail network linking Canada, the U.S. and Mexico.
“We see some great opportunity, especially with companies trading into Mexico,” Agriculture Minister David Marit said.
“It just gives another opportunity for us to move our product out of this province without having to go east or west.”
Marit said Mexico is Saskatchewan’s fifth-largest trading partner and those numbers have been rising over the last few years, hitting $1 billion last year.
He said this is an opportunity for companies in Saskatchewan and Mexico to expand even further now that there could be a direct link.
“Those companies are doing business in all of Latin America, so now we have access to, I would say, probably in the neighbourhood of excess of 300 million people,” said Marit.
Marit didn’t have any concerns about the move distracting CP Rail from moving grain and agriculture commodities in Saskatchewan, saying it could mean the exact opposite.
And while CN Rail and the U.S. government had voiced some concerns about the acquisition reducing competition in the industry, Marit doesn’t share those concerns.
The deal is worth about $31 billion and the new merged rail line will operate 33,000 kilometres of rail and employ nearly 22,000 people.

Yet another potential casualty of the powerful rainstorms that drenched coastal California: hundreds of acres of fresh strawberries slated for America’s supermarket shelves this summer.
Industry experts estimate about a fifth of strawberry farms in the Watsonville and Salinas areas have been flooded since the levee ruptured late Friday about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco and another river overflowed. It’s too soon to know whether the berry plants can be recovered, but the longer they remain underwater the more challenging it can get, said Jeff Cardinale, a spokesperson for the California Strawberry Commission.
“When the water recedes, what does the field look like — if it is even a field anymore?” Cardinale said. “It could just be a muddy mess where there is nothing left.”
For years, California’s farmers have been plagued by drought and battles over water as key sources have run dry. But so far this winter, the nation’s most populous state — and a key source of food for the nation — has been battered by 11 atmospheric rivers as well as powerful storms fueled by arctic air that produced blizzard conditions in the mountains.
Many communities have been coping with intense rainstorms and flooding, including the unincorporated community of Pajaro, known for its strawberry crop. The nearby Pajaro River swelled with runoff from last week’s rains and the levee — built in the 1940s to provide flood protection and a known risk for decades — ruptured, forcing the evacuation of more than 8,000 people from the largely Latino farmworker community.
Farmworkers have seen their hours reduced or slashed entirely due to the storms, said Antonio De Loera-Brust, a spokesperson for United Farm Workers. The most critical issue, he said, is helping those in the community of Pajaro rebuild.
The overwhelming majority of U.S.-grown strawberries come from California, with farms in different regions of the state harvesting the berries at distinct times of the year. About a third of the state’s strawberry acreage is in the Watsonville and Salinas areas, according to the commission.
Peter Navarro grows strawberries, raspberries and blackberries on a farm by the Pajaro River. He said he was fortunate his fields weren’t flooded by the levee rupture, but still expects his crop to be delayed several weeks due to the rainy, cold weather.
After planting berries last year, Navarro said he and other farmers were concerned about water sources drying up due to prolonged drought.
“When it started raining, we were elated, happy, saying, ‘This is what we need, a rainy season,’” Navarro said. “We certainly were not expecting all these atmospheric rivers. It just overwhelmed us — and overwhelmed the river.”
Other crops are also affected by the deluge in the Pajaro Valley, such as lettuce and other greens. Some vegetables had already been planted, but many hadn’t, and might see delays in planting due to the storms, said Norm Groot, executive director of the Monterey County Farm Bureau.
“Right now, I think everyone’s out trying to save the farm, so to speak,” Groot said, adding more rain was forecast for the weekend.
Monterey County is home to Pajaro and the crop-rich Salinas Valley, and has more than 360,000 farmed acres, said Juan Hidalgo, the county’s agricultural commissioner. The county estimates the farm sector was hit by $324 million in losses from January storms, and strawberries, raspberries and greens will likely be affected by this one, he said.
But, he added, many acres of farmland won’t be, and consumers may not feel the impact of the storms. “We’re still going to have a lot of production,” he said.
A challenge for strawberry growers is the plants are already in the ground. Soren Bjorn, president of Driscoll’s of the Americas, said the company works with a network of independent growers to package, ship and sell strawberries. In the Pajaro Valley, farmers did their planting last fall so the berries would hit stores during the summertime when it’s too hot to grow the fruits further south, he said.
Right now, farmers can’t even access the fields, because roads are covered in water. But with about 900 acres (364 hectares) under water in the Pajaro Valley and another 600 acres (243 hectares) flooded in nearby Salinas, Bjorn said the potential impact is significant, especially as farmers not only face the challenge of mud-soaked plants but also damaged equipment.
In the peak of the summer, Bjorn said most of the strawberries in the country come from this region.
“It’s too soon to know the full impact of this,” he said. “There is no way we are going to get what we had planned for.”

That’s according to the Chicken Farmers of Saskatchewan, who told farmnewsNOW in a statement that there’s currently no issue.
“We are in a unique position in Canada, as the flexibility of the supply management system allows the Canadian poultry and egg sectors to adjust production to demand, and we predominantly provide for the domestic market,” their statement read. “We have farmers in every province across the country, which always helps us ensure products for Canadians, even in times of uncertainty.”
Avian influenza, also known as bird flu, is a viral infection that spreads easily among birds. In many cases, this virus ends up being fatal.
As of Mar. 15, 2023, there were 71 infected premises across the country. This is impacting more than 7.1 million chickens. 
The hardest hit province is British Columbia, which has around half of the infected premises and half of the impacted animals. To help farmers and ranchers, the B.C. government has announced $5 million in funding to help protect farms from animal diseases. This also includes swine fever and foot-and-mouth disease.
“It is important that we continue to work together and stay vigilant to protect farmers and their animals, which protects B.C.’s economy and our food security,” said Pam Alexis, B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture and Food.
Meanwhile, people worried they can catch bird flu from affected chickens can breathe a sigh of relief.
The Government of Canada has said there’s no public health risk related to avian influenza. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, humans have gotten the virus in the past, however, it’s a very rare occurrence. 
“Human infections with bird flu viruses have occurred most often after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with bird flu viruses,” said the CDC. 
More information on avian influenza can be found on the CDC and the Government of Canada’s websites.

PrairiesCan, a federal department that diversifies the economy across the Prairies, is supporting Protein Powered Farms ($3 million), Saskatchewan Food Industry Development Centre ($1 million), and SeedMaster Manufacturing ($602,500).
Don Henry, the CEO of SeedMaster, told farmnewsNOW this funding will help them automate some of the work in their Emerald Park plant.
“The demand for our product has grown substantially and we needed to update some of our products and processes in our plant in order to meet our demand.” 
This includes new welders, overhead cranes, and a loading dock.
The roughly $600,000 SeedMaster is getting only covers half of the expected cost for the planned upgrades. The rest of the funds will be covered through their operating funds.
Henry explained the funding is also a loan and not a gift. Despite this, it helped them make the decision to move forward with the project.
“It helps us make that capital expenditure… it’s always a challenge making large capital expenditures in our business without knowing what the future holds,” Henry said. “It made our business decision easier.” 
According to PrairiesCan, Protein Powered Farms will be using the $3 million to install new plant-based fiber and extrusion equipment which will help them increase their ingredient processing capacity and develop new products. Just like SeedMaster, Protein Powered Farms funding is a loan.
As for Saskatchewan Food Industry Development Centre, PrairiesCan explained the $1 million will help the group enhance its co-packaging capacity for the provincial agri-food sector. This funding is a contribution from the federal government meaning they don’t have to pay it back.

The RCMP Livestock section is now attempting to find a motive for the senseless killings.
“They don’t belong to anyone. They have been roaming that area for a long time, like several other areas of the province that have feral horses that are just there. I can’t imagine a motive for why someone would want to do it. Especially where it was — they weren’t bothering anyone,” said Cpl. Cory Lepine.
RCMP were alerted to the killings Friday (Mar. 10). Lepine was able to confirm that some evidence was collected at the scene but cautioned the investigation could take some time. He noted that the horses were found spread throughout the area.
“There were two separate areas, one with six and the other with about 11, and they were spread out over quite a distance individually. They weren’t in a group. Whoever did this definitely took the time to track them or follow them one-by-one and shoot them,” said Lepine.
RCMP investigators from the force’s Forensic Identification Section were joined by a livestock investigator and a veterinarian in probing the scene this past weekend.
“I’ve been to other situations, neglect-type situations where the numbers were high, but as far as out on the range, a random animal, this is definitely the largest. We do have range animals. Most of the time it’s cows that are shot for no apparent reason. But this is definitely very troubling”
The 17 wild horses did have cultural significance to the Skeetchestn First Nation band, but the band declined to comment to CFJC Today. The RCMP is working with the band on the investigation.
UPDATE: Late in the day, the Skeetchestn Band provided CFJC Today with this statement:

Reeves, councillors and other RM reps grilled cabinet ministers on topics including SaskPower’s wind and solar farming, deer and elk control measures, taxation rates and Indigenous reconciliation and engagement, along with questions on why there still isn’t reliable cell and Internet coverage in many rural areas.
Questions on rural physician and nurse recruitment, mental health and addictions resources and a lack of services in remote areas dominated much of the discussion.
The new $200,000 rural and northern physician recruitment incentive was touted by Premier Scott Moe as making Saskatchewan competitive with other provinces, but the premier noted there were other issues that still need to be addressed.
“We have a number of retention incentives (and) recruitment incentives that are in place for hard-to-recruit areas of our health-care system,” Moe said.
“Whether it’s a physician, a nurse practitioner (or) an RN, we are targeting those incentives to those areas where we do have challenges — challenges in recruiting someone new, or challenges in retaining folks who are already there.”
Moe said the provincial government is also working to bring on more health-care support staff who are badly needed in many parts of the province.
“We’re doing that through immigration, we’re doing that through increasing training, and we’re also doing that using incentives to retain,” Moe added.
SARM president Ray Orb said there were a lot more questions than there were answers from the provincial government during the session.
“Going through the pandemic, of course there were some rural hospitals that had their ambulance services or their emergency services closed, and we’re hearing about that,” Orb said. “We’re asking the province to put a kind of rural lens on this.”
While he said the physician recruitment initiative was a great idea, Orb noted there were other issues that need to be addressed, like making sure rural areas have reliable broadband access and adequate policing.
If those problems are solved, Orb said rural Saskatchewan would become more attractive to prospective health-care workers.
The convention continues Thursday.

Cartier Farms has partnered with McMaster University to see if Equine Assisted Learning (EAL) could be a viable treatment to help with symptoms and improve functionality.
The goal is to get 80 participants split into four different rounds. They will then be split again with one half getting to experience EAL treatment, while the other half does not.
“We’ll figure out if there are differences in those two groups that would suggest that the EAL helped or didn’t help,” said Ashley Williams, postdoctoral fellow with McMaster University’s trauma and recovery unit.
After the study, those who didn’t get to take part in the sessions will be able to do so. 
As for those chosen for EAL treatment during the study, they’ll get to take advantage of two sessions a week over an eight-week period.
Each participant, whether they’re getting the treatment or not, will be interviewed before the study, when it finishes, and then three months down the road. 
Williams explained this is a relatively new area of research. She noted there has been some work done looking into horses helping veterans.
“There seems to be some indication that it could be helpful for veteran populations so we wanted to see what this would look like for public safety populations,” Williams said.
She added they understand veterans and emergency responders are two different groups, however, they are professions with exposure to trauma.
Meanwhile, those interested in taking part would have to be in the Prince Albert area for the entirety of the eight-week study since Cartier Farms is located just north of Saskatchewan’s third biggest city.
Gayle Cartier, co-owner of Cartier Farms, said she’s excited to see if their horses can make a difference in emergency responders’ lives.
She explained they were asked to take part after helping with two provincial studies.
“They were looking at the wellness that horses have in EAL with participants that are dealing with some sort of trauma or issue with wellness in general,” she said.
This study is expected to be more scientific, while also focusing on a specific group of people.
She’s also hoping this will prove that EA can be a successful therapy used in conjunction with other treatments and interventions.
The plan is to have the first round of the study start up in the spring.
Those interested in learning more about the study, including potentially participating, can call 647-551-2701, email ealteam@mcmaster.ca, or provide contact information to the research team online.

Dr. Hugh Townsend and Mort Seaman will officially be honoured on March 17 during the organization’s annual banquet in Saskatoon.
The SHF said they choose Townsend for several reasons. 
This included helping improve horse health through his work as a veterinarian, professor, scientist, and advocate. He also worked on improving vaccines for horses.
Townsend also helped raise millions of dollars for the Western College of Veterinary Medicine’s (WCVM) Townsend Equine Health Research Fund which was renamed after him in 2015. 
“Hugh’s many contributions to equine health and welfare continue to benefit the lives of horses in Western Canada and around the world,” the SHF said in a statement.
As for Seaman, the SHF explained he was chosen because of his dedication and work with horses in the Choiceland area dating back to the 1950s. 
“Whether it was for the local parades, giving the school students sleigh rides throughout the winter and wagon rides in the spring, or just heading to the coffee shop, the community could always count on Mort to have a team of Percheron horses in town,” said the SHF.
Seaman has also been a staple at Agribition over the years. 
The banquet is happening in the Canadian Room at the Saskatoon Inn.

A few years ago there were only five cows on her small family operation in Holoskovychi, a rural community an hour and a half east of the nearest city of Lviv, in western Ukraine.
Now she tends to 25 cows, six of which she bought after Russian forces invaded the country. 
Wrapped up against the cold with a kerchief tied over her head, the Ukrainian matriarch pointed out each by name, her voice full of motherly pride.
She credits her success to the creation of a Quebec-style co-op in her community and said a new Canadian dairy plant in the area is likely to help the local industry grow even more.
The project has become an unlikely symbol of defiance in the face of the Russian invasion.
Russia is stepping on Ukrainian farmers, Pastushok said through a translator during an interview in her farmhouse kitchen, “but we are developing in spite of them. We are who we are — Ukrainians.”
The $3-million dairy plant, funded by Global Affairs Canada, will produce milk, yogurt, sour cream and hard and soft cheeses using milk from the local dairy co-ops. Those co-ops will also have a stake in the management of the plant, which will employ 30 to 40 people. 
Construction was already well underway when war broke out last year and disrupted every aspect of life in the now embattled country. 
Investors at first shied away from putting their money into a project in conflict zone, said Camil Côté, the project officer for SOCODEVI, a development agency based in Quebec City that is spearheading the project.
The invasion put a stop to the work for about three months, until Canada offered another $2 million to get it started again. 
“Just like the whole of Ukraine, we survived the winter,” Côté said in an interview from Nicaragua. 
“We have (had a) few dangerous situations near the plant,” said Andriy Blinovskyy, who manages the project on behalf of a corporation of local dairy co-ops called Nabil. 
“We have missile explosion near the plant, when the electricity transformer station was destroyed maybe 10 kilometres from the plant.”
That explosion late last year forced workers to continue building through the winter without heat, using a generator for power.
When it’s up and running, the plant will mainly supply the Lviv region with locally produced products. The equipment and the brand new, gleaming milk tanks in each room carry Canadian flags.
“The factory is perceived as our own. Our country, our home, our family,” Pastushok said.
SOCODEVI first brought the Quebec-style co-op to Ukraine nearly a decade ago. It allows local producers with just a few cows to band together to negotiate for better prices.
“The needs in Ukraine are very similar to to what they were in Canada 50 or 60 years ago,” said Erin Mackie, a program manager for SOCODEVI.
“They were created because farmers needed to have that collective response in order to get the value added and to be able to generate a better income for themselves,” she said. 
Ukrainian farmers were initially hesitant to sign on, since the co-operative model conjured memories of state-run operations under the Soviet Union. Mackie said the development agency worked to convince them that the plans was, in fact, democratic and capitalist.
The model is based largely on Quebec’s Agropur, the largest dairy co-op in Canada. 
“This is how Agropur started, with a small co-op where you process milk,” said Céline Delhaes, who sits on the co-op’s board of directors, in an interview from her farm outside of Montreal. 
She said it’s much easier for farmers to negotiate fair prices as a group than to negotiate one-to-one with large companies to process and sell their milk. She also said the profits will stay in local communities. 
Delhaes travelled to Ukraine several times before the COVID-19 pandemic to coach local farmers and help them with the administrative aspect of setting up their co-ops.
The Ukrainian programs were growing steadily, as more and more farmers like Pastushok signed on, before the war began.   
“People started selling cows. Some due to their illness, while young people went to work abroad. And it turned out that it became very expensive to cultivate the land,” Pastushok said. 
She hopes more farmers in the region will join. 
“We need to unite. Like this proverb, ‘One man in the field is not a warrior,'” she said. 
Mackie said the aim is to create a national movement in Ukraine, in line with Canada’s dairy industry, and Canada’s decision to continue with the plant’s construction is a show of faith in the country’s future. 
“It’s faith in the Ukrainian people, that they would overcome this,” she said. 
The milk plant is by far the most modern-looking building in the area, its white siding and black roof standing out in stark contrast to its wood and stone neighbours. 
Blinovskyy said he hopes it will be ready to accept milk from local cows this spring. 
“It’s very powerful sign for all — for our enemies, for our friends, that Canada supports Ukraine and that the plant will start producing,” he said.

While in Saskatoon for the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) annual convention, Sylvain Charlebois — professor in food distribution and policy at Dalhousie University’s Agri-Food Analytics Lab — spoke with Gormley on Tuesday morning.
Charlebois said people are starting to become more knowledgeable about food processes, and a greater awareness of the moving parts affecting what people eat is being realized.
However, Charlebois said he thinks the significant role Saskatchewan plays globally when it comes to food security is not being very well-recognized in Central Canada.
“There’s a lot of noise in Central Canada that really doesn’t allow many city dwellers to fully appreciate what’s at stake here — global food security,” he said.
If Saskatchewan were to be invaded or disrupted, Charlebois hypothesized, a large number of markets would be disrupted.
Part of that is owing to Saskatchewan’s economic diversity. With the province choosing to invest in numerous opportunities — from livestock and crops to uranium and potash — rather than going all-in on one single resource, Charlebois said Saskatchewan has an expanded reach and greater offerings.
Charlebois also noted a shift in tone in Saskatchewan politics around resources over the past decade or more. He said seeing companies like BHP discussing potential partnerships with other companies like Nutrien suggests future moves are “inevitable.
“I think they’re just waiting for the right environment and context,” Charlebois said. “Saskatchewan has a lot of things the world needs.”
However, with food inflation still in the double digits — around 11.5 per cent, though general inflation is slowing — Charlebois told Gormley a key focus is going to be strengthening Canada’s competitiveness.
With operational margins in Canada significantly higher and stable, Charlebois said grocers have had it easy in recent months.
However, he noted significant factors like interprovincial barriers and heavy fiscal issues in the form of taxes and restrictive labour laws between provinces need to be addressed.
And the difficult market has been evidenced by seeing companies like Target, Sears, Lowes and Nordstrom leave the country.

Dan Vandal, Minister of Northern Affairs, PrairiesCan and CanNor, said this funding will help the areas getting hit the hardest by rising food prices and operating costs. 
The funds are coming from the Harvesters Support Grant, which provides funding for traditional hunting, harvesting, and food-sharing activities, and the Community Food Programs Fund which provides funding for community food-sharing initiatives including group ordering, and Elder and school meal programs.
“Indigenous and northern communities know how to best support their own food priorities,” Vandal said. “These initiatives are central to our government’s response to food security in the North and Arctic and will help strengthen food sovereignty in northern and isolated communities.”
The majority of the communities being supported are in the three territories – Nunavut, Yukon, and the Northwest Territories – however, areas in Ontario, Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Manitoba, and Alberta are also benefitting.
There are also three Saskatchewan communities receiving funding: Fond-du-Lac, Uranium City, and Wollaston Lake. The Prince Albert Grand Council is getting around $241,000 which will be split amongst the three communities.

The AgriStability program for the 2022 farming year will stay open for B.C.’s agricultural sector until June 30, 2023, for farmers and producers to pay fees and secure coverage.
The provincial-territorial program supports growers who face large financial declines caused by production loss, disease outbreak, and increased costs or declining market conditions.
The federal ministry of Agriculture and Agri-Food stated some B.C. crop producers have been dealing with production losses and revenue declines due to extreme weather events, while many poultry producers in the Fraser Valley have been affected by severe avian influenza outbreaks.
These factors are what led B.C. producers to be included within the program.
“Allowing late participation in AgriStability will help more farmers manage the impacts of the many challenges they face on their farms,” Marie-Claude Bibeau, Federal Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, said.
“I encourage eligible farmers to take advantage of the support available to improve their situation and get back to what they do best – producing high quality foods.”
AgriStability provides personalized coverage for each farm based on income tax and production information. It is described as a whole-farm, low-cost business risk-management program aimed at helping farms facing large declines in net income.
Late participants in the program will have their fees reduced by 20 per cent.
“By allowing late participation in AgriStability, we will be able to offer financial support to more farmers and producers who need assistance due to factors, such as weather and disease, that were out of their control,” B.C.’s Minister of Agriculture and Food, Pam Alexis, said.
“We recognize the challenges our agricultural community have faced over the past year, and we encourage anyone who is eligible to retroactively sign up, so they can improve their financial situation for the coming year, while continuing to produce the products we all appreciate and rely on.”
AgriStability program costs are shared 60 per cent by Canada and 40 per cent by B.C.
Farmers and food producers can sign up for the AgriStability program through the B.C. government’s website.

According to Farm Credit Canada’s (FCC) Farmland Values Report, the average price for these properties rose by 12.8 per cent last year.
The average for four provinces was higher than the national average: Ontario (19.4 per cent), PEI (18.7 per cent), New Brunswick (17.1 per cent), and Saskatchewan (14.2 per cent).
Alberta and British Columbia’s values were the lowest among all the provinces, however, they still rose by 10 per cent and eight per cent, respectively.
The FCC said a big reason for the jump is supply as there are fewer farmlands available for purchase which helps raise the price for the ones that are. Nova Scotia, Manitoba, and Quebec each saw increases of around 11 per cent.
“Any neighbouring farmland parcel coming up for sale can generate significant buyers’ interest considering that this may happen only once in a lifetime,” read FCC’s report.
Also playing a part in the growth was improved weather conditions which helped raise farm cash receipts to $94.9 billion. This is up roughly 14 per cent from 2021. Each province saw increases with Ontario, Alberta, and Saskatchewan leading the way. 
The FCC adds the last reason for the growth in value was non-traditional buyers.
“These buyers may be individuals, groups, or other entities looking to buy farmland without the intent of farming,” the report said. “It is next to impossible to determine the extent of the presence of non-traditional buyers in the farmland market as there’s no single database across the country that contains all the relevant information.”
Despite this, the FCC estimate that between nine per cent and 15 per cent of cultivated farmland sold in 2022 was purchased by non-traditional buyers.

The event will take place at Studio Three at 406 First Ave. W. from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., March 19. 
Willow Creek Community Garden and ML Seedy Sunday coordinator Pat Morley said the event will be a good opportunity to swap seeds, purchase or make a donation for more, and also learn some new gardening tips. 
“It’s promoting gardening in the community, so we can be mutually supportive of one another,” she said. “We’re promoting some vendors that are coming to sell their own stuff. But our biggest [focus] is the seed exchange.” 
People are invited to bring their own seeds to swap with other gardeners. 
“That’s the whole idea,” Morley said. “We’re promoting sharing, and exchanging extras. If they bring something, they can exchange it for something else that they need on the exchange table, or they can visit the vendors and purchase new seeds.”
Some of the popular items people can pick up include seeds to grow pumpkins, squash, tomatoes, celery, and peppers.
“And, there will be a whole whack of flowers people usually bring with seeds,” Morley added.
A number of guest speakers are also planning to participate, starting at 2 p.m.  
Now retired agronomist Dave Cubbon will talk about garden pests and diseases. Carmen Howell will chat about pressure-canning tips; Rachelle Ternier with Prairie Garden Seeds will focus on seed saving; and Christine Simoens, a Willow Creek Community Garden board member, will discuss the benefits of dandelions.
Morley commented dandelions are good to have around for many reasons.
“They actually are one of the first pioneer grains. They came as a seed to our country. And, they grow so prolifically,” she said. “The whole plant is edible. They are very high in calcium and vitamins. They are one of the first flowers for our bees, which is really important. That’s why we really try to get people not to spray dandelions because the bees get killed from it.”
Morley added the reason dandelions have such large taproots is that they break up hard clay soil, and then they pull calcium up to the surface. 
Among the benefits of the plant, its roots make a tasty, healthy tea when they are dried. 
A number of vendors will have tables at Seedy Sunday, including Home Hardware, the event’s main sponsor, Knapp’s Heritage Seeds, Prairie Garden Seeds, Green Goddess Plants and Seeds, Tartan Skye Honey, and Simoens.   
There is no cost to attend the event. People taking part will also be able to enjoy a coffee, tea or a quick snack during their visit.
Morley said there are always lots of benefits to sharing seeds, so she invites people to come out.
“It really promotes community,” she said. “The prices of everything have skyrocketed. [So,] we are also encouraging seed saving. When you save a lot of seeds you can’t use them all, so that’s one way to share them, and promote seed-saving.”   
Morley noted when there is an opportunity to share seeds, it also makes it easier for people to access certain seeds they are looking for when they want them.
She added Seedy Sunday is also simply a great way to “build community.”  
“It brings people together, especially to learn and grow,” she said. “You’re not just learning about gardening, you’re learning about a lot of different things. You build community by sharing and having community events.”

The Prairie Grain Development Committee (PGDC) is a forum for the exchange of information on the development of improved cultivars of grain crops for western Canada.
The four independent recommending committees are responsible for the testing, evaluation, and recommending of grain crop candidate cultivars for registration.
The Pulse and Special Crops Committee has recommended 16 new lentil, 13 pea, five faba bean and five dry bean lines for registration.
Dr. Glen Hawkins chairs the committee. He is also a senior manager and agronomist with DL Seeds in Edmonton, Alta.
“We probably saw the largest number of lines up for recommendation that I’ve seen in my 10 or 11 years on this committee. An emphasis on field pea for sure, faba bean lines, a good chunk of lentils, and then a few specialty peas and some dry beans,” Hawkins said. 
This is the first time in several years marrowfat peas have been recommended along with the first forage pea under new, special guidelines.
Hawkins said there is also new yellow peas.
“The thing that raised a few questions was a company with yellow peas that have a substantial yield drag,” he said. “But our committee recommended them based on the work they’ve been doing on flavour profiles and processing efficiencies.”
Hawkins said there are faba bean lines being recommended that are low tannin and several lentil lines that range from small red to large red, to greens and black, as well as French green lentils.
The committee has made its recommendations and now the companies that presented the varieties are tasked with finding someone that’s to willing to license and grow the seed in Canada. Hawkins said this all takes time.
“There’s a couple things that play into it. How quickly are organizations out there that sell seed, looking to replace aging varieties, how quickly can they get those agreements in place, and then it comes down to how much seed is available? A lot of these lines are coming through on marginal amounts of seeds,” he said.
As producers get comfortable with certain varieties, sometimes, they are reluctant to try something new. Hawkins said he hopes producers will give new varieties a chance. 
“My rebuttal to that is we’ve made some huge advances in genetics, standability, yield, and protein content in the last 10 years and I really urge farmers to have a look at that,” Hawkins said. 
There are three other review committees: wheat, rye and triticale, oats and barley, and oilseeds. 
The Prairie Grain Development Committee held its annual meeting in Banff last week.

Alberta wheat producers can claim 74 per cent Scientific Research and Experimental Development Fund (SR&ED) credit on their 2022 taxes.
This is for wheat producers who pay check-off through the AWC and do not request a refund.
As an example, producers who paid $100 in check-off to AWC in 2022 would earn $74 in tax credit. 
AWC chair Greg Sears said the SR&ED program is extremely valuable.
“I would encourage all eligible wheat farmers to make their claim,” Sears said. “If you’re a wheat producer in Alberta who pays checkoff, I cannot recommend the SR&ED program enough, especially given that the tax credit is higher than it’s ever been before.”
This is due to the high ratio of research investments made by AWC in relation to the revenue from check-offs in the 2022 tax year which were reduced by approximately 40 per cent due to the 2021 drought. 
The tax credit percentage is based on the amount invested in R&D that meets the criteria laid out by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).

The National Farmers Union (NFU) said workers rights and employer vigilance are needed to stop human trafficking.
In a statement, the NFU said it was horrified by the recent news of human traffickers exploiting 64 undocumented Mexican workers, forcing them to live and work in appalling conditions, including on Ontario farms. 
Farmers across Canada have been approached in-person, via email, or by phone by aggressive recruiters promising an easy solution to get much needed labour.
To report a potential human trafficking case, call the Canadian human trafficking hotline 24/7 at 1-833-900-1010.

The Grain Growers of Canada (GGC) wanted the strategy to focus on innovation, research, and beneficial management practices, representing a practical and proactive approach to tackling climate change. 
Recommendations will guide government policies and programming directed at Canada’s grains sector. 
CropLife Canada President and CEO Pierre Petelle said it advocates for a science-based regulatory environment that enables innovation in Canada. He said Canadian farmers have long been early adopters of new technologies, including plant science innovations, which has made them global leaders in sustainable production. 
“From seed technology to the pest control tools that protect crops, the plant science industry is committed to providing solutions that support Canadian farmers as they work to address the global challenges of food security, climate change and sustainability,” Petelle said. 
CropLife Canada represents the manufacturers, developers and distributors of pest control and modern plant breeding products. 
GGC Chair Andre Harpe said advancements in plant science are the backbone of innovation and growth.
“Farmers have always known that productivity and sustainability must go hand in hand,” Harpe said. “The plant science industry is a leader in sustainable intensification, and CropLife Canada’s insights will be invaluable as we develop our ‘Road to 2050’ recommendations.” 
Previously announced industry partners include Corteva Agriscience, Fertilizer Canada and Cereals Canada. 
Harpe said the experience and expertise of its industry partners and advisory council will help develop climate solutions that unleash the grain sector’s full potential.
“CropLife Canada brings a wealth of knowledge to the table and will be a valuable voice,” Harpe said.

Maple Leaf Foods raised its dividend as it reported a loss of $41.5 million in its latest quarter due in part to weaker pork markets and a cyberattack.
The food processing company said it will now pay a quarterly dividend of 21 cents per share, up from 20 cents per share.
The increased payment to shareholders came as Maple Leaf said its loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 amounted to 34 cents per share compared with a profit of $1.9 million or two cents per share in the last three months of 2021.
Sales totalled $1.19 billion, up from $1.12 billion a year earlier.
Maple Leaf said it lost 28 cents per share in its fourth quarter, compared with an adjusted profit of nine cents per share a year earlier.

British Columbia is dedicating $200 million toward boosting both the province’s food bank system and overall agricultural production and resiliency.
Premier David Eby said the funding will go toward two branches of spending: adding infrastructure to food banks, such as commercial coolers, and to improve overall food production and access throughout B.C.
Part of the money will be used to enhance programs to strengthen the food supply chain; expand food production from processors, packers, and retailers; and fund climate preparedness measures.
Eby said the “historic” investment in B.C.’s food security comes as a direct response to events that occurred in the past few years, when flooding, wildfires and COVID supply-chain bottlenecks cut crucial supply lines in the province.
Eby said the spending also gives agricultural producers an opportunity to grow their businesses while improving climate preparedness and allowing more B.C.-produced food to be consumed by residents.

This year’s theme, Building a Resilient Future for Canadian Agriculture, was especially meaningful after the challenges of the past few years, according to CFA President Keith Currie. 
“Agriculture has experienced many disruptions that have affected the entire food supply chain. COVID, climate change, transportation disruptions and trade wars are all uncontrollable circumstances that farmers often find themselves affected by,” Currie said. “As we enter into this new era, it’s important that Canada pivots to focusing on the resilience of essential industries like agriculture to ensure that we can continue to act as a reliable global food supplier.”
Currie said the value of this meeting is bringing the agriculture sector together to develop policy solutions and build partnerships that moves the industry to success.
CFA membership passed 54 resolutions that covered a range of issues, from conservation, climate change, labour, rural infrastructure, crop protection, to international trade, and risk management.
Leaders from every major party spoke to the gathering including Pierre Poilievre, Leader of the Conservative Party, Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet, Jagmeet Singh, Leader of the NDP and Elizabeth May with the Green Party.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau repeated his government’s plans to reduce carbon emissions and to assist agriculture in meeting those long-term goals.
Trudeau reassured CFA delegates that his government is not planning to regulate fertilizer use but it does want to reduce emissions through technological innovations.
“All of you know that being able to target your fertilizer use better is really important because it keeps costs down and it increases or maximizes yields and that is absolutely something we need, we can’t have yields be going down,” Trudeau said. “That’s why whether it’s looking at how we’re bringing down the price of fertilizer or supporting you during this difficult time where the cost of Russian fertilizers have gone up because of their decisions to invade Ukraine, making sure we’re there to support you in various ways. But  making sure we’re also there for the kinds of technological innovations that are going to be a key part of making sure the world can feed itself in a net zero economy in 2050.”
CFA announced the winner of the Brigid Rivoire Award for Agricultural Mental Health. The Guardian Network was created through a partnership with the Canadian Mental Health Association – Ontario (CMHA-ON) and the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA).
The Guardian Network is a volunteer suicide prevention network which supports Ontario’s farming community. Guardians are equipped with strategies and tools to identify the signs of mental distress, react to farmers at-risk, and connect Farmers to appropriate mental health and crisis resources.
The Guardian Network Program Manager Marnie Wood said it was an honour to receive the award.
“When we launched The Guardian Network to help support farmers at-risk of suicide, we felt a sense of urgency and this support from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture will help us as we continue to grow the network to save farmers’ lives and livelihoods,” Wood said.
This was the last CFA convention for outgoing president Mary Robinson. She served in the role for four years.
With Robinsons’ departure new CFA Executive Officers were acclaimed. Keith Currie is the new CFA President, Todd Lewis was named first Vice-President, and Pierre Lampron is CFA 2nd Vice President. 
Currie said the industry’s ability to deal with the problems of tomorrow relies upon how we approach the challenges of today. 
“By building a robust and resilient food production system in Canada we can continue to take advantage of our wealth of natural resources in a sustainable manner that can provide food for the world for generations to come,” Currie said.
Recordings of the panels, political speakers as well as accompanying documentation, including passed resolutions, will be posted on the CFA website.

Corteva Agriscience has launched a new fungicide.
Viatude protects against sclerotinia in canola and white mould in soybeans. 
The fungicide provides multiple modes of action for resistance management and contains a unique combination of two active ingredients that includes Onmira™ active, which provides holistic and long-lasting coverage. 
Corteva Portfolio Marketing Manager Kirsten Ratzlaff said sclerotinia and white mould have the potential to significantly impact yields.
“That is why we are pleased to offer Viatude fungicide, a new crop protection tool that will provide best-in-class protection to help prevent yield loss and protect profitability,” Ratzlaff said in a news release.
Sclerotinia and white mould are significant crop diseases that result in millions of dollars in yield loss every year. The disease can overwinter and remain viable as sclerotia for many years, with potential to affect other broadleaf crops including pulse crops, sunflowers, and mustard.

The Canadian Centre for Agricultural Wellbeing (CCAW) is receiving a federal investment of $168,440.
The funds will help the non-profit spread awareness and multiply available resources for the agricultural community.
“Farmers have a very demanding job and deal with a lot of stress,” Marie-Claude Bibeau, Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, said at the inaugural National Symposium on Agricultural Mental Health, which this funding helped create. 
“Mental health issues are so often taboo in the sector, which is why initiatives like the ones created by the Canadian Centre for Agricultural Wellbeing are so essential to open the dialogue and, ultimately, save lives.”
The CCAW works with national and global leaders in agricultural mental health to conduct research and develop programming and education that addresses challenges related to the well-being of Canadian farmers.
“The Canadian Centre for Agricultural Wellbeing is very pleased to work in partnership with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada to develop evidence-based programming and supports for the well-being of Canadian farmers,” Dr. Briana Hagen, Chief Executive Officer and Lead Scientist, Canadian Centre for Agricultural Wellbeing, said.
“Together, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Canadian Centre for Agricultural Wellbeing, will continue to eliminate barriers to accessing mental health services across the country.”
As of time of publication, CCAW had not responded to Vernon Matters’ request for comment on what other programs this funding would support, or if any programs or initiatives are located in the Okanagan.

ADAMA Canada said it will have products with the ingredient available to retailers and farmers across the country. 
The decision comes after several months of consulting with retailers, farmers, and industry organizations on the implications of Pest Management Regulatory Agency’s (PMRA) ruling to re-evaluate the permitted uses of the insecticide. 
Lambda-cy is the active ingredient in two ADAMA products, Silencer and Zivata, which are both marketed for use on multiple crops. 
The April 2021 decision required lambda-cyhalothrin products to be relabeled with new usage guidelines. To comply with this decision, ADAMA Canada has now completed the relabelling of existing inventories of Silencer and Zivata to ensure farmers have the most up to date information for the 2023 season. 
General manager Cornie Thiessen said ADAMA will continue to sell its lambda-cy products with the new labelling. He said ADAMA is confident that its retail partners will provide good advice to growers.
“We trust growers themselves to use the product responsibly and within permitted guidelines,” he said. “The bottom line for growers is to read the labeling guidelines carefully. Talk to your full-service input retailer and to your crop buyers so you can make an informed decision about if and when to apply the product.”

Coyote Pancake Mix was introduced in 1923 by Rockport Flour Mills in Magrath, Alta. Nearly 100 years later Coyote Pancake Mix is making history again by joining a national Ecolabel program that provides critical habitat for ducks, birds, and other wildlife. 
The Habitat-Friendly Winter Wheat Ecolabel Program is an initiative that helps consumers identify environmentally friendly products that support the nesting habitats of Canadian wildlife on the Prairies. 
Research conducted by Ducks Unlimited Canada has proven that ducks nesting in winter wheat are 24 times more successful than those nesting in spring-planted cereal crops. 
All three varieties of Coyote Pancake and Waffle Mix are made with whole-wheat flour milled from spring wheat and winter wheat grown by Rockport and area farmers and are available nationally at traditional and online retailers. 
Coyote Pancake Mix Production Manager Jake Wipf said participating in the program makes sense since it represents a purposeful way to preserve a variety of water birds in the wetlands and lakes around Magrath. 
“Rockport Flour Mills cares deeply about the environment and the impact our operations have on it,” Wipf said. “We are pleased to share that we have been audited and met the requirements for Habitat-Friendly Winter Wheat certification. All three Coyote Pancake and Waffle Mixes are made with flour containing at least 30 per cent habitat-friendly winter wheat.”
Alberta winter wheat farmer Gary Stanford has grown winter wheat for over a decade because of the many benefits it brings to his farm. He is especially fond of the high yield potential and less disturbance to wildlife, especially waterfowl.
“I am pleased to see more local businesses support growers,” Stanford said. “Winter wheat is an important crop for my operation as it benefits the sustainability of my farm both environmentally and fiscally.”
The partnership includes Cereals Canada, Ducks Unlimited Canada, Prairie winter wheat grower groups, and end-users including millers and food processors. 
The initiative helps brands stand out in a competitive marketplace, satisfies consumer demand for sustainability on store shelves, and supports Canadian farmers while providing critical habitats for ducks, birds, and other wildlife. 
Winter wheat’s habitat conservation combined with the benefits it offers farmers are what interests Ducks Unlimited Canada the most. 
Cereals Canada said food processors can become certified to showcase their use of western Canadian winter wheat. 
Cereals Canada Director of Market Intelligence and Trade Policy Leif Carlson said they are also encouraging other Canadian brands to adopt a blend of habitat-friendly winter wheat in their products to embrace sustainability, preserve waterfowl habitat and support Canadian farmers. 
“It’s exciting to see Coyote Pancake Mix and the Ecolabel on Canadian store shelves,” Carlson said. “The Habitat-Friendly Winter Wheat program communicates agriculture’s positive contributions to the environment and gives families a choice that they can feel good about.”
Other Ecolabel partners include Les Moulins de Soulanges, a mill producing specialty flours serving artisanal bakers across North America, and Beam Suntory, a global leader in premium spirits. Beam Suntory is participating through its Northern Keep vodka brand, which is distilled in Calgary, Alta.

Pricewaterhouse Coopers International was appointed receiver for Merit Functional Foods.
Merit CEO Ryan Bracken said the company founded in 2019 was not able to get the cash flow it needed to operate profitably, and the COVID-19 pandemic affected its business plan.
Manitoba Pulse and Soybean Growers executive director Daryl Domitruk said Merit had contracts for about 10,000 acres of peas and the receivership is going to be felt by farmers in the upcoming growing season.

Alberta farmers will have to pay more for crop insurance this year as the United Conservative Party government’s budget includes a 60 per cent increase in premiums.
The budget stated the rate hike will raise the crop insurance fund balance back to a level recommended by actuarial evaluations.
The government said the rates are going up because of higher crop prices, more producers participating in the insurance program and the effects of the 2021 drought.
Last year, Alberta crop producers paid a total of $324 million in insurance premiums.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has revoked five primary control zones for the highly contagious avian flu.
It said this happens when post-outbreak surveillance is completed, and no further cases of avian influenza are detected.
The agency’s website showed the number of birds that have been impacted in the province as of Wednesday was 3,657,000.
It said that while the virus affects birds, there is no evidence it can be passed to humans who consume poultry products.

There has been increased use of these products on the prairies, according to Dr. Breanne Tidemann, a research scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada based in Lacombe, Alta.
Tidemann said PGRs are chemicals that are applied to plants that change how they grow. In western Canadian agriculture, it is typically used to shorten the plants and then reduce their chance of lodging in field crops. 
“Wheat and barley in particular are the two that we’re using them on, and the goal is to be able to up nitrogen rates and still get some increased yield, but not get the increased height with the plants falling every which way that we sometimes see when we do that,” Tidemann said.
Several PGRs have been registered for use. Tidemann said PGRs are most often used on wheat but there has been more adoption in the malt barley industry as well which is the basis of her research.
“We looked at three different PGRs, ethephon, chlormequat, and trinexapac. We use active ingredient names, we don’t use brand names, to look at how they would affect lodging in CDC Copeland malt barley,” she said. 
Tidemann said researchers did everything they could to try and encourage lodging.
“We upped nitrogen rates, and we upped seeding rates and we still had site years that didn’t lodge, of course, because that’s how research goes,” she added. 
Tidemann said the impacts on yield, lodging, kernel weights and plump. Samples were sent the Canadian Grain Commission to look at the actual malting quality of those samples. 
There was a lot of variability in the results.
“It’s not the level of consistency we would have liked so there were site years where we would see reductions in lodging from the PGR applications,” she said. “But there was also the odd year where we saw increases in lodging from PGR applications.” 
Tidemann said, for the most part, there were benefits in terms of reduced height and reduced lodging with ethephon and trinexapac. Ethephon also tended to have some increases in days to maturity or increased tillering. There were some negative quality impacts as well. 
“From our study the most consistent and the one with the least negative impacts would have been trinexapac, but it still wasn’t a guarantee that if you sprayed it, it wouldn’t lodge,” she said. 
Tidemann said her recommendation from the research is PGRs are worth a try.
“There could be some varietal sensitivity where the variety we chose wasn’t super sensitive to PGR,’ she said. “But if you’re going to start looking at it on your farm, make sure you’re including a check strip to see if you’re getting the benefit you’re desiring out of that application and the money you’re spending on it.”

Skyline Dairy has been recognized as Grand Champion of the Dairy Farmers of Manitoba’s (DFM) Milk Quality awards.
The farm, which achieved an average somatic cell count of 57,000 is the first robotic dairy in the province to win the honor. 
The farm in Grunthal, Manitoba milks with four DeLaval VMS™ V300 units that were installed in the spring of 2022 after using VMS Classic robots since 2008.
Tristar Ag dairy herd advisor Jarryd Preston said Skyline’s success is due to owners and brothers David and Charles Wiens. 
“The team at Skyline has great managers, very forward thinking. They prioritize using the best solutions with the best practices to help them reach their goals,” Preston said.
David Wiens said the farm is motivated to achieve excellence in dairy because it aligns with other industry partners and what the consumer expects and deserves. 
“Continual focus on the details and improvements for the cows, from diet to comfort and environment, are contributing factors,” Wiens said. “Our staff is also of great importance to achieving this.”

The $13 million from the Youth Employment and Skills Program (YESP) will support roughly 1,200 jobs.
Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth Marci Ien said YESP will make sure everyone, regardless of their identity has a fair chance at success in many in-demand sectors, including the ever-growing agriculture sector.
“By giving young people, particularly those facing systemic barriers to employment due to their gender, race, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, disability or other intersecting identities, the opportunity to gain valuable work experience, we are breaking down barriers and creating endless potential for what they can achieve tomorrow,” Ien said.
The program offers support for 50 per cent of wages to a maximum of $14,000 to agriculture employers hiring youth. 
Employers that hire youth facing employment barriers will be eligible for 80 per cent of the cost of salaries and benefits and may be eligible for an additional $5,000 to address specific obstacles to employment. 
Applications are open until March 7 for their project to be considered. 
Under the program, applications from Indigenous applicants will be prioritized for the 2023-24 program year.

The Beef Cattle Research Council (BCRC) is celebrating 25 years as Canada’s national industry-led funding agency for beef, cattle, and forage research. 
A new video has been released to acknowledge the milestone and features some of the key individuals of the BCRC’s past to present. 
Rob McNabb was BCRC manager from 1998-2006. He said industry input was important to the initial development of the BCRC.
“The story of BCRC is one of evolution,” McNabb said. “We started with some very small projects. We were a minor player in the funding game. Governments and research institutions were beginning to recognize the industry needed to be at the table for funding decisions.” 
Producer councils representing provincial cattle organizations from across the country make funding decisions.

Agriculture Minister David Marit revealed the details for the 2023 program year. He said customers will see an individual premium calculated for each crop they insure. Premiums are individualized based on a producer’s personal claim history compared to the area risk zone. 
“This means a producer’s claim on one crop does not impact their premium for a different crop,” Marit said. “Producers will see these individual premiums be more reflective of what they are experiencing on their own farm.”
Marit said the premium discounts and surcharges previously used in the Crop Insurance Program are discontinued.
Producers will see a 7.2 per cent increase in insured prices in 2023 as compared to 2022.
For example, the insured price for hard red spring wheat is $10.21 per bushel compared to last year’s price of $8.71. Canola increases to $18.83 per bushel. Last year it was $17.01 per bushel. Large green lentils will be 40 cents a pound compared to 36 cents last year.
SCIC Acting President and CEO Jeff Morrow said the average coverage for 2023 is at a record-high level of $446 per acre, while the average total premium is $14.79 per acre, an increase from $12.05 in 2022.
“The coverage increase is driven almost exclusively by those commodity price increases. So that has an impact on the premium cost as well, because as coverage goes up, so does the premium cost per acre,” Morrow said.
The average coverage for 2023 is at a record-high level of $446 per acre, due to increased commodity prices and yield coverage. 
Morrow said the 2021 loss experience totalled $2.5 billion. He said 2022 claims are still being finalized, but they expect payouts to be above $1 billion with most claims coming from the west-central and southwest parts of the province.
The maximum dollar coverage levels of the Unseeded Acreage component will increase. While the minimum coverage remains the same at $50 per acre, additional Unseeded Acreage coverage levels are increasing to $75, $100, and $125 per acre. That coverage offsets some of the costs associated with summer fallow acres too wet to seed due to excessive spring moisture.
Another change for the 2023 program year is the Agristability compensation rate will increase from 70 per cent to 80 per cent.
SCIC offers a full suite of business risk management programs. This also includes Livestock Price Insurance and the Wildlife Damage Compensation and Prevention Program.
The deadline for farmers and ranchers to make changes to crop insurance must be done by March 31, otherwise a producers’ coverage will remain the same as last year.
Moe information is available at scic.ca or by calling 1-888-935-0000.

The federal Pest Management Regulatory Agency recently altered the approved uses for lambda-cyhalothrin, a pesticide used to control grasshoppers and flea beetles.
The change means the chemical can no longer be used on any crop that could end up as livestock feed and as a result, the manufacturers have pulled it from Western Canada.
Both provinces said due to continued drought in some parts of Alberta and Saskatchewan, grasshoppers are again likely to be a significant concern in the coming growing season.

An Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Saskatchewan panel has found an engineer in the province guilty of three counts of professional misconduct.
One of the complaints against Scott Gullacher pertains to the rural municipality of Clayton’s Dyck Memorial Bridge, which collapsed moments after it was opened on Sept. 14, 2018.
Another complaint related to five municipal bridges, one in each of the RMs of Scott, Caledonia and Mervin and two in the RM of Purdue.
Due to the panel’s findings, Gullacher is prohibited from practising engineering in Saskatchewan as an interim order until a final decision on his conduct comes next month.

As part of its ongoing partnership, the Global Institute for Food Security (GIFS) at the University of Saskatchewan (USask) announced the inauguration of an agricultural technology centre at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI) in Gazipur, Bangladesh. 
This marks another milestone in the partnership’s goal of delivering sustainable food security through programs in Bangladesh focused on enhancing farmer incomes and addressing the effects of climate change.
The ag-tech centre will offer programs to enhance crop breeding and plant improvement, soil health and quality, improve soil water retention, and increase data management and analytics.
This includes another specific area of concern, post-harvest food handling and processing.
Bangladesh has chronic food security challenges that are increasing due to a rapidly growing population, climate-induced stress like salinity intrusion, drought and heat, loss of agricultural land because of rapid urbanization, and post-harvest loss.
The technical expertise comes from the Global Institute for Water Security, the Saskatchewan Food Industry Development Centre, USask colleges, the Prairie Agricultural Machinery Institute, and the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
The inauguration of the Bangabandhu-Pierre Elliott Trudeau Agriculture Technology Centre was announced on Feb. 23. 
Led by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau at the time, Canada was one of the first countries to recognize Bangladesh’s independence in 1971. The name of the ag-tech centre reflects this legacy.

Canola oil, canola seed and non-durum wheat make up the top three exports. Canola seed made up 54.5 per cent of total exports to Mexico, with a total value of over $557 million. 
Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said the province has been sharing Saskatchewan’s story around the world, and the world is listening.
“Advancing Saskatchewan’s trade interests while strengthening existing partnerships benefits all of Saskatchewan,” Harrison said. “As an export-dependent province, this work is integral to grow our economy, create jobs and drive growth that works for everyone.”
The single biggest increase last year was canola oil with exports up over 79 per cent compared to 2021.

Representatives from Soy Canada recently returned from their first in person mission since 2019. 
The mission connected the soy industry with customers in Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.
Soy Canada Executive Director Brian Innes said there’s nothing like being face-to-face to share and understand how Canadian soy delivers value to their customers.
“The enthusiasm we saw this year shows the value of our market development investment and how we can grow the value of our industry in the future,” Innes said.
From Feb. 8-16, a delegation of 26 Canadian representatives met with more than 220 current and potential customers to develop markets for Canadian soybeans.
Exporter and producer members of Soy Canada heard firsthand the quality specifications customers are looking for when purchasing soybeans, visited manufacturing facilities to see how Canadian soybeans are processed, and shared how the latest developments in the Canadian soybean industry provide value for customers.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government is looking at how it can provide targeted aid to farmers who are struggling with inflation.
Trudeau, who made the comments at a meeting with farmers at the headquarters of Quebec’s farmer’s association, the L’Union des producteurs agricoles in Longueuil, said he wants to ensure that any aid for farmers doesn’t make inflation worse.
He said that while inflation has started to slow, the government wants to ensure farmers and others who are struggling can hold on for the next six months to a year.
Daniel Lebelle, a dairy and grain farmer from the Centre-du-Quebec region, told the prime minister that his costs have risen 40 per cent since inflation began to rise.
Cattle and blueberry farmer Yves Laurencelle said while it’s fine if assistance is targeted, farmers can’t afford to wait.
He said it’s not just a business issue, it’s also emotional because when a farm goes bankrupt, farmers often lose the land worked by their parents and grandparents.

The work at the University of Saskatchewan (USask) found the gene encodes for an enzyme named EstT is capable of turning off macrolides, a class of antibiotic drugs commonly used to treat disease in cattle and other livestock. 
Tylosin, tilmicosin and tildipirosin are some antibiotics classed as macrolides. 
Dr. Poonam Dhindwal said veterinarians rely on these drugs to treat illnesses in cattle such as bovine respiratory disease and liver abscesses as well as other diseases in livestock and companion animals. 
“There’s a possibility that the drug will not work because of the presence of the gene,” Dhindwal said.
Antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the global spread of antimicrobial resistance. Based on 2019 estimates, more than 1.2 million human deaths were caused by drug-resistant infections. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) are mobile genetic elements that can pass between micro-organisms and help to accelerate resistance. 
The USask research team made the discovery after analyzing bacteria collected from watering bowls at a western Canadian beef cattle feedlot.
The research was led by assistant professor Dr. Tony Ruzzini in collaboration with Dr. Murray Jelinski.
“[Our discovery] adds one more piece to the puzzle,” Jelinski said.
Scientists have previously identified the existence of this gene that’s commonly found in many animal pathogens and their microbiomes, but its purpose remained a mystery. 
Ruzzini said the research team discovered the gene can break the ring structure of the antibiotic through hydrolysis which is a chemical reaction caused by water. 
“If you break the ring or you open the ring with water, then you disrupt the active shape of the antibiotic. So, it no longer has a high affinity for the target,” Ruzzini said. 
Once the gene destroys the antibiotic’s structure, the drug is no longer able to work as effectively in treating an illness.
The team found the gene in a cluster with three other ARGs. Ruzzini said this was the first clue that it could be involved in antimicrobial resistance. Once the team identified the gene, team members worked to clone it and test it against a panel of many antibiotic drugs from different classes. 
“This gene, even though we found it in an environmental organism, it is also present in pathogens that are responsible for causing bovine respiratory disease (BRD),” Ruzzini said. 
The team’s work should be of interest to all researchers in both human and animal health fields who are studying antimicrobial resistance. 
Ruzzini added that his research team is continuing to learn more about how EstT works. 
“As AMR surveillance systems rely more on molecular tools for detection, our knowledge of this specific gene and its integration into those systems will help to better inform antimicrobial use,” Ruzzini said.
The Saskatchewan Health Research Fund, Saskatchewan Agriculture Development Fund, the Beef Cattle Research Council, and the Mitacs Globalink Internship program supported the research.
The findings were published online last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal.

SARM President Ray Orb said the expansion could more than double the irrigated land in the province, not only opening new farmland to consistent water supplies, but also facilitating industrial and potash mining operations. 
“The government has already allocated $45.5 million for preliminary engineering and environmental work on the first phase of the project and has said construction could start in 2023,” Orb said. “At this time, most of the work beyond rehabilitating existing canals is in the conceptual phase, and there are many unanswered questions.”
SARM wants an update on Phase 1 in Division 5. With 90 per cent of the current canal already in place, Orb said RMs will see water flow and processing, and employment opportunities increase. 
The project was announced by Saskatchewan government in 2020. Orb said RMs will reap the rewards of irrigation after some very hard years of drought.

A Ukrainian farmer said Canadian grain storage supplies arrived just in time to save crops from rotting in their field after the Russian invasion blocked the ports used to export those yields.
Oleh His runs a farm in a small town near the border with Poland, far from the front lines of the war, but said the conflict made the last growing season incredibly difficult.
He said the cost of diesel and fertilizers have gone up, and with the Black Sea effectively blocked most of the year farmers had far fewer options to sell their harvest.
His said he knows of some farms that went bankrupt but added he has been able to hold onto his grain and export it to Poland during the winter when it was more profitable to offset extra costs.
Help came in the form of grain bags as part of an aid partnership between Canada, Japan, and the United Nations.

The Ministry of Agriculture Wheat Midge map shows potential hot spots for the pest.
Saskatchewan Seed Growers Association President Kurt Printz said the areas of concern are largely on the eastern side of the province. He said this an increase compared to last year’s growing season.
Wheat is making this year challenging is the loss of products to control the pest. In particular, the active ingredient that is found in Lorsban and Citadel.
“We know any insecticide isn’t ideal,” Printz said. “These broad range insecticides can be harmful to beneficials in the field.  Insecticides also have a narrow window of application and aren’t always the most user friendly product to use.”
Printz said the best strategy is to seed a Midge Tolerant variety which has been available to producers for roughly 10 years. Those varieties are a blend.
“They’re composed of approximately 90 per cent of a variety that has the Sm1 gene that makes it resistant to Wheat Midge and then 10 per cent is what we call a refuge variety which is susceptible to Midge,” Printz said. “What that does is it prevents a buildup of naturally occurring resistance. In the Midge population across the province, there’s a small percent that are resistant to the Sm1 gene which means they’re unaffected. Without the use of this refuge variety and the varietal blends we see a quick build up of resistant Midge.”
There are several Midge Tolerant Wheat varieties available. Printz said producers have several options to choose from when they are looking for a wheat variety that works best on their farm.
Printz noted producers need to sign a stewardship agreement when they buy a Midge Tolerant variety.
“The agreement says you can only save seed from the first generation to reseed. That’s because we know midge are attacking the refuge variety and then that reduces the percentage of refuge variety in the blend. You don’t want that refuge to go away which would correspond with a buildup of the resistant midge,” he said.
Printz said he believes there is a good supply of Midge Tolerant varieties available but advises farmers to talk to their seed suppliers sooner rather than later to secure seed.
“I would just add that growing a midge tolerant wheat is a very responsible decision farmers can make, and it allows them not to worry about spraying for Midge later on in the year, so it’s nice to deal with the problem now compared to June or July,” Printz said.

Michael Eskin, a Food and Human Nutritional Sciences professor at the University of Manitoba, started studying canola oil in 1968.
MCGA president Chuck Fossay said Eskin’s involvement in canola oil research throughout his career is what made him stand out.
“From his early involvement in the development of canola oil, to his efforts in solving problems associated with the oil over the years, to his current work with colleagues looking at some of the antioxidant and anti-cancer properties of the phenolics in canola, Dr. Eskin has a long list of accomplishments and MCGA is thrilled to recognize him with this award,” Fossay said.
Eskin said his role was to look at the composition, stability, and performance of the oil that would become canola.
“We were commissioned by the Canola Council of Canada to prepare the first major booklet on canola oil, to promote its science and technology to health professionals, and food industry people around the world,” Eskin said.
The 82-year-old Eskin continues to teach, publish, and supervise students at the U of M.
In 2022, Canada exported 2.6 million tonnes of canola oil, valued at $6.2 billion. Domestically, canola oil has become the number one edible oil in Canada, representing more than half of all vegetable oil consumed in the country.

The community and and many visitors gathered for a ceremony to welcome them home.  
Chief Tanya Aguilar-Antiman said it’s a historic moment for the First Nation.
“We do our best to bring wealth and good to our community, for all,” she said. “We truly believe that the spirit of the buffalo is going to help us, each and every one of you, nation to nation. All our visitors that come from the North, the South, the East and the West, thanks for coming out here and supporting us.”
The MGBHLM First Nation spent the weekend preparing for the arrival of the bison.
“We’re really excited to have bison back in our nation,” Aguilar-Antiman said.

The MGBHLM community received 22 bison from Elk Island National Park through Parks Canada.
MGBHLM made a gift application for bison to Elk Island and invested their own source revenue for fencing, feed, support from the bison crew, and transportation costs.
“Our CEO from economic development, Grant [Grant Beaudry], made a request,” Aguilar-Antiman said. “It took two years to get to this point. We’re really excited and pleased for this opportunity.” 
The bison will stay in a large enclosed territory of about 1,000 acres where they will be able to run freely and settle in to their new home .
“We’ve been told that they will definitely check out their territorial [area], check out the fence lines, and then we’ll see,” Aguilar-Antiman said. “You’ll get to see them when you are driving on Highway 4 South… Our knowledge keepers will definitely be a big part of any ongoing development with our bison.”
A couple of years ago bison herds were also released at Poundmaker Cree Nation and Onion Lake Cree Nation, as more First Nation communities see the return of the bison to their home lands. 
The Buffalo Treaty
Many area First Nations in the North West region also took part in a signing ceremony of the Buffalo Treaty  last year, during the Battlefords Agency Tribal Chiefs Inc. (BATC) three-day powwow at Sweetgrass First Nation. The treaty is described as an agreement of “cooperation, renewal, and restoration,” to return the buffalo to the Prairies and First Nation communities.  
Sweetgrass First Nation Chief Lorie Whitecalf said following the signing ceremony the Buffalo Treaty has great significance to Indigenous Peoples, on many levels.
“Our people utilized the buffalo entirely, every part of the buffalo was used,” she said. “[First Nations] want to bring those teachings back – not just about using the buffalo, but our traditional way of life… This treaty is bringing all the nations together to sign and work collectively, to go forward with education, economics and health.”

Saskatchewan’s Water Security Agency (WSA) is offering free workshops to introduce farmers and ranchers to the Agricultural Water Management Strategy.
WSA Executive Director of Communications and Client Service Patrick Boyle said this is the second consecutive year WSA is hosting these workshops. 
“One of the things that every producer deals with is managing water whether it’s the southwest where often times there are shortages or to the east of the province where they have to deal with too much water,” Boyle said.
Boyle said the workshops explore the process and benefits of obtaining drainage approvals and techniques to best manage water on their land. 
“These are free half day workshops that are online and in person until April 2023. Scheduled in-person sessions start in March. We’re offering that free workshop to understand how we can support farmers and ranchers across Saskatchewan to manage water on their land,” he said.
AgH2Onward consists of five modules that include various types of water management practices such as surface ditches, tile drainage and wetland consolidation, completing a network project with neighbouring landowners, and using a qualified person to assist landowners through the process. 
AgH2Onward Coordinator Julie Mackenzie said often the biggest challenge is knowing where to start. 
“These workshops will introduce producers to well-designed drainage projects and help them incorporate strategies best suited for their farm or ranch operations and the regional landscape,” Mackenzie said.
Online workshops are being held Feb. 28, March 13, and March 28. Details on the in-person workshops will be released at a later date.
Producers can learn more and register at agh2onward.ca. WSA will also host in-person or online workshops for organizations, groups or communities upon request. 
Much of Saskatchewan’s runoff comes from snowmelt. WSA staff will be doing snow water equivalent sampling to help create a more accurate picture of spring runoff potential. Samples will be taken from 100 sites.
A column of snowpack is collected in a graduated tube. Staff weighs the samples and then calculate the average snow-to-water equivalency for that area. 
Surveys from across the province contribute to the runoff potential map released every spring. The information is used by municipalities, producers, industry, and other users.

They are worried that could lead to supply problems in the beef industry over the longer term as climate change makes drought, flooding and wildfires more common.

Branch manager Travis Loblaw said the agriculture sector is very important to the community of Nipawin and the surrounding area. He said over 50 per cent of their customers are involved in agriculture in some form.
“I think in most of rural Saskatchewan, there’s an understanding that without strong support in the ag sector, a lot of our communities wouldn’t thrive. We realize we can support our communities by supporting the ag sector itself,” he said. 
The Nipawin Scotiabank team set up a display in the branch that included contributions from local businesses and organizations. Loblaw said they wanted to showcase different aspects of agriculture.
“We partnered with the local IGA to bring in some produce to show how the supply chain works in the community. We were able to partner with the Nipawin Museum and bring in a cream separator,” Loblaw said. “Ainsley Nickel brought in one of her beautiful horses.”
Loblaw said they were also happy to have local farmers stop by the branch and join in the celebration. 
Loblaw said the staff enjoys participating in the event.
“The staff has got gotten so pumped about this. The last three or four years, now the celebration has grown and grown. Who knows what’s going to happen next year?”

The Resilient Rotations project is part of the Integrated Crop Agronomy Cluster (ICAC) that is evaluating various crop rotations to help create more productive, sustainable, and resilient cropping systems on the prairies. 
The project is led by Dr. Kui Liu, a research scientist with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC). 
“We are approaching crop rotation by looking at a systems approach – all the elements that impact crop rotation from soil health, economics and yield to local growing conditions,” Liu said. “It’s a more holistic way to look at crop rotation and one we hope will provide new insights and options for farmers in Western Canada in a more customized, prescriptive type of approach.”
The team is evaluating six different crop rotations at seven field sites across the prairies. There are three sites in Alberta, three in Saskatchewan, and one in Manitoba. Data from the four-year rotations have been evaluated by region based on yield, economics, and efficient use of both precipitation and nutrients.
WGRF Executive Director Wayne Thompson said agronomists, weed scientists, pathologists, economists, and soil health experts are involved in the project.
“It’s a testament to the diversity of factors that impact an effective, sustainable, and productive approach to crop rotation. WGRF invests in research like the Resilient Rotations project with the goal to help farmers make decisions that are the best fit for their operation,” Thompson said.
The survey can be accessed here while the factsheets can be found on the WGRF website.
The Resilient Rotations project is supported by funding from WGRF, Alberta Wheat, Sask Wheat, Alberta Pulse Growers, SaskCanola, Manitoba Crop Alliance, and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada through the Canadian Agricultural Partnership— a provincial-federal-territorial initiative.

The Canadian Agricultural Human Resources Council (CAHRC) is developing a program that helps key sectors of the economy implement solutions to address their current and emerging workforce needs.
Labour continues to be the most serious issue facing Canada’s agriculture and agri-food industry. Like other sectors, agriculture and agri-food are struggling to attract workers from a limited and shrinking labour pool. 
Roughly 40 per cent of employers surveyed in primary agriculture reported not being able to fill vacancies and the industry suffered earning losses of $2.9 billion in total sales due to unfilled vacancies tied to the pandemic.

Shell and S&W Seed Company based in Colorado will work together to develop and produce sustainable biofuel feedstocks.
The joint venture called Vision Bioenergy Oilseeds LLC will develop Camelina while the oil and meal will be extracted for future processing into animal feed, biofuels, and other bioproducts. 
S&W Seed Company CEO Mark Wong said Camelina is recognized as a low greenhouse gas cover crop and is a commercially viable oilseed with the potential to be a sustainable feedstock source for the energy transition. 
“We are pleased to be entering this joint venture with Shell, which leverages our seed and technology capabilities with Camelina and demonstrates how agriculture and energy can work together to lower carbon emissions by producing domestically sourced sustainable biofuel feedstocks,” Wong said.

The announcement was made at the Ag Awareness Summit in Saskatoon, Sask.
Each year, the Farm & Food Care Saskatchewan Champion Award recognizes a person who has engaged consumers about agriculture and worked to build public trust in farming and food in our province and beyond. 
Koch has been involved in the agriculture industry, both professionally and personally, for most of her life. She and her husband, Gerry Hertz, farm at Edenwold, Sask. 
Koch is the chair of the Global Institute for Food Security. She previously served as Deputy Minister to the Premier and Cabinet Secretary for the Saskatchewan government. Prior to that, she was Saskatchewan’s Deputy Minister of Agriculture for nine years, one of the longest-serving Agriculture Deputy Ministers in Saskatchewan and Canadian history. 
Koch’s priority in government was to build and maintain public trust in agriculture by focusing on science-based decision-making and communicating the benefits of modern tools and technology. 
Before joining government, Koch served as President of the Canadian Agri-Food Trade Alliance, a director with Agricore United and Executive Director of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. 
She has been recognized with multiple other honours, including a Women of Distinction Award for excellence in Leadership and Management from Regina YWCA, the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal,  Saskatchewan Centennial Medal, and the Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame. 
Koch said in her acceptance speech that there are many people who do so much and she was honoured to be recognized.
“What better way to make a difference in the world than to champion the best people and the best industry? To be able to share our story of how we farm and why we need innovation and access to all the tools and technology to sustainably feed the world is where so much of our focus has been the last 10 years, since the very first Ag Awareness Summit,” Koch said. “We have come so far and made huge progress on getting our message out and we have so much more to do.” 
“Farm & Food Care Executive Director Clinton Monchuk said the organization was pleased to recognize Koch.
“She is well-known within Saskatchewan and around the world as a tireless advocate for agriculture in our province. We’re so proud of the amazing people this award recognizes,” Monchuk said.
Less than three per cent of Canadians have a direct connection to the farm, which is one reason why so many have questions about how their food is produced. 
Farm & Food Care works to address consumer questions and inspire more confidence in farmers and in Saskatchewan-grown foods.

The $10 million Weston Family Soil Health Initiative hopes to expand the adoption of ecologically based beneficial management practices (BMPs) including cover cropping, nutrient management (4R principles) and crop diversification/rotation that increase soil organic matter to improve biodiversity and resiliency on agricultural lands across Canada.
The project, Indigenous Soil Health Learning Circles for Resilient Prairie Agroecosystems, will establish a network to share evidence-based, culturally significant outreach and education to improve prairie soil health, biodiversity, and soil organic matter for First Nations agroecosystems.
USask soil scientist Dr. Melissa Arcand will be working in partnership with Mistawasis Nêhiyawak, Saskatchewan Aboriginal Lands Technicians, and the International Buffalo Relations Institute. 
“Our project will expand soil science training beyond the walls of the university-alongside teachings of Indigenous ecological knowledge-onto lands that are of significance to the First Nations we are in partnership with,” said Arcand said. 
The Soil Health Learning Circles will share soil health knowledge from both an Indigenous and Western science-based perspective with First Nations and farmers who farm First Nations lands in Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Manitoba.

Canada’s agriculture and food industry had another successful Drive Away Hunger campaign, with more than 40 million meals provided to food banks and feeding programs across the country.
Founded by Farm Credit Canada (FCC), the industry-wide initiative has been collecting food and cash for nutritious meals for the past 19 years. 
FCC executive vice-president and chief marketing officer Todd Klink said the initiative provides a way for the agriculture and food industry to positively impact food security in Canada.
“Local food banks play an important role in communities across Canada as they support the ongoing need to provide nutritious food for families,” Klink said.
Since 2004, the agriculture and food community has come together to raise 141 million meals through food and cash donations for those facing food insecurity in Canada.

The National Farmers Union is travelling across the country to film 40 sustainable farms.
The NFU is teaming up with documentary filmmakers Tamer Soliman and Sarah Douglas of March Forth Creative Inc. to produce and present Depth of Field: Films About Farming – short documentaries highlighting farm stories from across Canada. 
In spring 2023, the filmmakers will begin traveling and filming on location, completing the films by 2024. Canadians will learn about agriculture in Canada from the farmers, farm workers, producers, and land stewards themselves. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is providing the NFU with up to $253,726 in funding for this project through the AgriCommunication Program. 
Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said farmers are taking action to ensure their production processes are increasingly more sustainable. 
“Organizations like NFU that showcase the sector’s leadership in sustainability are helping to build public trust in Canada’s food system,” Bibeau said.
The NFU will share the films online and at local screenings in collaboration with other farmer organizations during the fall and winter of 2023-24.

The McKenzie brothers have returned in a campaign to stop the increasing tax on beer.
Bob and Doug are rallying Canadians to oppose Ottawa’s plan to increase the federal tax on beer by 6.3 per cent on Apr. 1, the biggest increase in 40 years. 
A series of commercials call on the federal government to “take off the beer tax increase, eh!” 
Beer Canada President CJ Hélie said Bob & Doug have joined the HereForBeer community to help keep beer affordable for Canadians.
“Actually, they have been Here for Beer for more than 40 years,” Hélie said. “Beer helps bring neighbours, friends, coworkers, and communities together and governments should not push it out of reach of hardworking Canadians.” 
Government tax already makes up almost half of the cost of beer in Canada.
Beer lovers can go to HereForBeer.ca and use the site’s tools to send a message to their Member of Parliament.

Building public trust is a major component of the 2023 Agriculture Awareness Summit in Saskatoon, Sask. today. The inaugural summit was held in 2013.
Farm and Food Care Saskatchewan sponsors the event along with the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture, with funding from the Canadian Agricultural Partnership (CAP).
Farm and Food Care Executive Director and local farmer Clinton Monchuk said Canadians are becoming more removed from primary agriculture. Communicators and leaders attend the summit to explore how the industry is adapting to changes in public perception and connecting with consumers.
“These past 10 years have shown that consumers want to engage with farmers and ranchers about how food is grown. We are continuing to create those opportunities,” Monchuk said.
The event brings industry together so efforts related to public trust and connecting with consumers can be more focused and unified. The summit features speakers from a variety of backgrounds to discuss topics such as communications, consumer trends, dealing with unexpected change and how to use social media effectively.
Canadians from coast to coast are invited to participate in Canada’s Agriculture Day celebrations, a day that highlights the food we love and the people who produce it.
The day also recognizes the efforts and accomplishments of farmers and agri-food industry and is an opportunity to express gratitude to farmers for their hard work, regardless of weather conditions and challenges.
Agriculture and Agri-Food Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said as more people seek to better understand where their food comes from, the summit will help producers connect with consumers and showcase the agriculture industry.
Bibeau said it is a good time to ‘raise our forks’ to farmers.
“Their passion, tenacity, adaptability and commitment to the protection of the environment and animal welfare allow us to continue being a global leader in sustainable agriculture,” Bibeau said.
Canadians are invited to share their love for food today by using the official hashtag #CdnAgDay on social media. 
Some creative ways to join the online celebrations include preparing a meal made from Canadian ingredients, sharing photos and videos of Canadian agriculture and local food, and thanking farmers for their hard work and nutritious food they provide to Canadians and people around the world.

The Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB) has partnered with Cargill to launch the Certification Recognition Credit.
Up to $400 will be provided for operations maintaining their CRSB Certification. 
The pilot of this Cargill-funded credit will fill the gap for Canadian producers who have made the upfront investment of becoming CRSB Certified but did not receive at least $400 in financial return for qualifying cattle processed in 2022.
Cargill Sustainability Program Lead Jeffrey Fitzpatrick said they wanted to recognize the commitment of Canadian producers.
“Only in supporting programs like the CRSB Certified Sustainable Beef Framework will we be able to more accurately create and sustain the highest standard of sustainability practices across the Canadian beef supply chain,” Fitzpatrick said.
Ryan Beierbach is a beef producer from Whitewood, Sask. and the chair of the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef. He said it’s good the supply chain recognizes the ongoing efforts of producers. 
“Realizing this credit is a pilot, the CRSB is working with Cargill and other industry supply chain partners and stakeholders to identify long-term resolutions to ensure qualification provides financial value and enduring benefit to producer participation,” Beierbach said.
Additional information on the new Certification Recognition Credit, as well as the existing Qualifying Cattle Credits, can be found on the Cargill website.

The Flax Council of Canada is trying to determine what method the European Food Safety Authority is using to test for hydrocyanic acid.
The EU has established new maximum levels of hydrocyanic acid in flax that went into effect Jan. 1. The acid is a health concern because it is converted to cyanide in the intestinal tract of humans.
The council is working with the Canadian government to determine what testing method is used and to answer any questions the regulator has about Canada’s flax.
The flax industry has had a troubled past with EU restrictions, highlighted by the Triffid incident, and regulations regarding cadmium in flax.

The barn located in the Sturgis area was a total loss, according to Olymel’s vice-president of production Casey Smit.
“A very unfortunate event. Our staff were on site, they spotted a fire, and called it in to 911 immediately. Obviously, they exited the building and waited for the fire department to come. But, unfortunately, just for the size of facility and how quickly the fire spread, the fire department wasn’t able to do anything more than sort of monitor the situation and unfortunately the barn was completely destroyed,” Smit said.
The pigs in the barn were of various ages. Smit said it was part of a production flow.
“There would have been young pigs and older pigs throughout the barn. There are basically two wings in the barn so it’s a continuous flow of operation,” he said.
There is a second Olymel barn and feed mill about half of a kilometre away. Those facilities were not affected.
Smit said fire officials and insurance inspectors are on site today. He said there will be an assessment of the situation. Once that is complete the company will determine the next steps.

The program, commonly known as the cash advance, is used by many farmers to cover the working capital requirements of putting in the new crop.
CCGA Director of Finance and Operations Dave Gallant said a $250,000 interest-free limit is in effect for this year.
“With rising interest rates, the savings a farmer can realize from using the advance program are more significant than ever, taking into consideration the interest-free component and the interest-bearing rate,” Gallant said. 
This year’s program will be similar to last year’s in several ways. The increased $250,000 interest-free component continues for 2023, and CCGA’s interest rate will remain at prime less 0.75 per cent on up to an additional $750,000, according to Gallant. 
“Prime is 6.7 per cent right now so that means our rate on the interest bearing is 5.95 per cent,” he said. “Just to give you an example, a farmer who borrows a half a million dollars into the program will save approximately $21,000 if they use the cash advance over borrowing from their local bank or their credit union.” 
There are no limits to how a farmer can put an advance to work on their farm, including financing spring inputs, investing in farm improvements or repairs, or general operating costs. Farmers can apply on over 50 commodities including field crops, large and small livestock, honey, and organic commodities. 
Gallant said rates for many individual commodities are higher than last year.
“For instance, canola is up $34 a tonne, wheat is up $29 a tonne. Some of the smaller products are down a little bit but overall, there’s a slight increase in the rates so farmers can still get more money this year than last year for the same basket of commodities when they apply,” he said. 
Gallant expects another busy year for APP. He said there was a lot of interest in the 2022 program through the CCGA.
“We did over 9,000 advances last year, and we saw a steep increase in the value of advances,” Gallant said. “Farmers took almost 40 per cent more than the prior years and we’ll finish the year issuing almost $2.3 billion to farmers in Western Canada.”
The process for applying has been improved. Gallant said farmers will benefit from several changes that will make the process easier. CCGA’s new online document submission feature simplifies several reporting requirements. 
CCGA has also streamlined the priority agreement process, which should make applying for a cash advance through CCGA faster for many customers.
Gallant said farmers should submit their paperwork early to maximize the benefits from their cash advance 
“We encourage first time applicants to apply through our contact center,” he said. “Our team is specially trained to walk new applicants through every step of the process, and for many applicants, it only takes 15 to 20 minutes.” 
Returning customers can use the self-serve options available from their online account or can also apply through CCGA’s contact centre. 
Farmers wanting to learn more about cash advances offered through CCGA can call 1-866-745-2256 or visit CCGA’s website.
Gallant said this is the last year for the $250,000 interest-free. That amount will go back to $100,000 for the 2024 program.

Saskatchewan’s Water Security Agency has released a preliminary spring runoff outlook.
The report shows a large portion of southern Saskatchewan will have below-normal potential for snowmelt runoff.
Central areas of the province have above-normal snowpack and are expected to get normal or above-normal amounts.
One area in southwestern Saskatchewan, including Maple Creek, is forecast to receive well below-normal amounts of runoff after warm temperatures eliminated almost all the snowpack.

Each year the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) calculates the date when a Canadian household of average income will have earned enough to pay for their entire year’s grocery bill. 
CFA examines the proportion of income that Canadians spend on food as a way to explore year-over-year expenditure changes and raise consumers’ understanding of Canada’s food system, from Farm-Gate-to-Plate.
Canadians spent 11 per cent of their disposable income on food last year, which is slightly higher than the 10.7 per cent spent on food in 2021. That makes Food Freedom Day one day later in 2022.
CFA President Mary Robinson said having this event fall a day later will likely come as no surprise.
“With food prices rising consistently and more quickly than overall inflation, we cannot ignore the challenges that many Canadians are facing when it comes to food affordability,” Robinson said. “While our food costs are low when compared to global standards, Canadians are seeing their disposable incomes shrink as it is taken up by the increasing costs of essential products.” 
Robinson said for many Canadians, the Food Freedom Day metric does not portray the experiences and struggles with rising food prices. Due to this, CFA took a closer look at the incomes of Canadian households.
There is a large difference between how much disposable income households with the lowest income and the highest income spent on food and beverages throughout the year. Lower-income Canadian households are facing a heavier burden when it comes to rising food costs.
While Canadians have seen food prices increase steadily throughout 2022 on the grocery shelves, farmers receive a small percentage of the price that consumers pay for food, and rising retail prices are not normally reflective of what is paid at the farm gate.
Farmers have seen their costs of production increase tremendously over the past two years, with many of their largest expenses, such as fertilizer and diesel, rising nearly 100 per cent in that period, according to Robinson.
While Canada’s food system provides access to affordable food by global standards, inflation, global events, and supply issues have led to sharp rises in price for food and other essential products, cutting into every Canadian’s disposable income.
“It is only through investing in resilience throughout our entire food supply chain that we can create a system less vulnerable to disruption that can provide Canadians affordable food even in the face of global supply chain disruptions,” she said.

The DFC Here for Tomorrow Scholarship, open to Canadian students in Grades 10-12, is being expanded from two to five recipients with the winnings increasing from $2,500 to $3,000 per student.
AITC-C’s thinkAG Project Coordinator Morgan MacTavish said last year’s applicants identified and explained how their interests related to careers in agriculture and food, and how vital those jobs are in global sustainability.
“Their expressive interpretations were filled with hope for the future. Being able to witness the ‘lightbulb’ moment when applicants realized that they have a place in agriculture was inspiring,” McTavish said. “We couldn’t be more excited to offer this opportunity again this year to remind youth that jobs in agriculture and food are as abundant as they are important.” 
Applicants need to submit a written 1,500-word essay, a three-minute video, or a visual arts piece which could include ceramics, drawing, painting, sculpture, design, craft, photography, or architecture.
Submissions will be accepted until May 1.

The Ontario Bean Growers are pleased the federal government is reimbursing farmers for fertilizer tariffs.
Ottawa has set aside the $34 million from the tariffs paid by Canadian farmers.
Ontario Bean Growers’ Executive Director Ryan Koeslag said while this is good news, it does not address that the tariff is still in place.
“Canada is the only G7 nation that is penalizing its own farmers with this tariff. The United States has never imposed a tariff on fertilizer from Russia or Belarus,” Koeslag said.
The Ontario Bean Growers, along with the Atlantic Grains Council, Christian Farmers Federation of Ontario, Grain Farmers of Ontario, and the Grain Growers of Quebec, want the federal government to directly reimburse the farmers. 
The collation has been working for many months to raise awareness of the challenges regarding the Canadian government’s decision to impose tariffs on Russia fertilizer imports and the impacts this has created for Canadian farmers. 
The group has met with Members of Parliament as well as decision makers in Cabinet minister’s offices and the public service. 
Koeslag said compensating farmers is the right thing to do.
“In a time of global uncertainty, reimbursing Canadian farmers for the tariff will balance some of the inflationary costs and help farmers grow more crops and food we need to feed Canadians and the world,” he said.

The leading agri-food export commodities last year were canola oil, non-durum wheat, canola seed, lentils, durum, and dry peas. 
Saskatchewan’s total exports have grown by more than $20 billion since 2012. 
Agriculture Minister David Marit said the sector is a model for reliability and innovation.
“Saskatchewan producers continue to make an impact both inside and beyond our borders, as a driver of our provincial economy and as a worldwide leader in sustainable agri-food production,” Marist said. “These numbers demonstrate our progress toward the $20 billion agri-food export target in the 2030 Growth Plan.” 
Higher-value processed products were also a key contributor to the province’s exports. Canola oil was Saskatchewan’s top agri-food export while canola meal was seventh. Saskatchewan’s agri-food exports are the second highest in Canada, behind Ontario which exported $23.8 billion in 2022. 
Trade and Export Development Minister Jeremy Harrison said Saskatchewan has what the world needs, and the latest statistics show that.
“Our products have made significant gains in both traditional and new markets, which means opportunity for greater investment and a higher quality of life for the people of our province,” Harrison said.
Merchandise exports saw a 23.8 per cent increase in December 2022 compared to December 2021. This was the second highest increase among provinces. Total merchandise exports for 2022 were valued at more than $52 billion, an increase of 41.7 per cent since 2021.
The province has established trade and investment offices around the world which assists in growing trade by focusing on Saskatchewan companies seeking investment and promoting trade. 
Saskatchewan’s top five international export markets are the United States, China, Japan, Mexico, and Algeria.

Davai A Plus, a broad-spectrum herbicide with two modes of action, will be registered for imidazolinone-tolerant lentils, peas, and soybeans. 
ADAMA Canada general manager Cornie Thiessen said Davai A Plus is one part of the company’s ongoing strategy to meet the needs of Canadian growers while adapting to ongoing global supply chain issues.
“This new registration brings product choice to growers for a crop that historically had none,” Thiessen said. “We’re proud to offer Canadian farmers a growing selection of high-quality crop protection products.”
ADAMA said lingering supply chain issues plaguing global industry have been complicated by the ongoing European energy crisis. This is expected to contribute to higher prices and product shortages for some crop protection products again in the 2023 crop season.
The Ukraine war and the resulting European energy crisis are impacting choices for Canadian farmers for the next crop year. Many of the most popular Canadian crop protection products and their active ingredients are manufactured in Europe. 
Thiessen said there are facilities in 35 countries that supply ADAMA. 
“This globally diversified supply chain has helped us cope with these global supply chain issues. We are confident in our ability to supply the Canadian market in 2023 and are pleased to announce some new products for pulse growers,” he said.

The Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) is in support of a bill that would legislate the protection of supply-managed sectors in Canada.
CFA president Mary Robinson says Bill C-282 would ensure the government does not make market access concessions in future trade deals for supply-managed products.
“It can be frustrating to watch promises fizzle when push comes to shove, and supply-managed farmers have seen successive governments renege on their promise to not allow further market access for supply-managed products,” Robinson said. “By voting for this Bill, politicians will be able to show their true support for supply-managed farmers and allow those farmers to rely on the law rather than rhetoric.” 
CFA has long advocated that no additional access to supply-managed sectors should be given in future trade agreements, and all political parties sitting in the House of Commons have committed to no additional access and no reductions in over-quota tariffs.
Robinson said despite these commitments significant concessions have been made in recent trade agreements including CETA, CPTPP, and CUSMA, which threaten to undermine the resilience and stable food supply this system affords.

Hundreds of farmers drove their tractors through Paris today in protest of banned pesticides.
The convoy entered the French capital through a southern gateway, before making its way to the Invalides monument— the site of Napoleon’s tomb.
They protested the French government’s decision last month to ban the use of pesticides on sugar beets and other crops.
The choice of Napoleon’s monument as the site of their protest was significant, as he imported sugar beets from Poland to ensure France’s sugar independence.

Agriculture and Irrigation Minister Nate Horner says producers and processors have been urging the government to do more to help grow the agri-processing industry.
The Alberta Agri-Processing Investment Tax Credit will provide a 12 per cent non-refundable tax credit aimed at supporting growth within the ag industry.
The government says the tax credit will be introduced in this spring’s budget.
Corporations must make a minimum capital investment of $10 million in value-added agri-processing in the province to be eligible for the credit.
Horner says the credit will allow the province to attract large-scale agri-food projects that will help grow the industry, increase opportunities for primary producers, create jobs and feed the world.
“There is good reason for Alberta to target investment in the value-added agriculture sector. The economic opportunity is huge,” he says. “As the global population continues to increase demand for processed and packaged foods is expected to grow considerably, and Alberta is well-positioned to meet this demand.”
Horner adds that when what is grown in Alberta is also processed here, the jobs and economic benefits stay in the province.

CASA’s BeGrainSafe program raises awareness of the risks of becoming trapped in grain, trains firefighters in rescue techniques, and makes available specialized grain rescue equipment to rural fire departments.
Since BeGrainSafe’s inception in 2016, firefighters have been trained to provide dozens of sets of rescue equipment in farming communities in Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec.
CASA CEO Andrea Lear said the long-term support has allowed the program to thrive.
“BeGrainSafe messaging around prevention has increased and more firefighters than ever have received the information they need to save lives to keep Canadian farms safe and sustainable,” Lear said.
BeGrainSafe Master Trainer and Safety/Training Officer for the City of Sarnia Russ Lloyd said they were able to train 87 firefighters in two weeks in their own department.
“Every day we respond to car accidents, kitchen fires, and incidents that we are well-trained in that we respond to all the time. We don’t get agricultural calls frequently, but because of the lower frequency, there is a high potential of risk – of not getting there fast enough, or not knowing what to do,” Lloyd said. “The BeGrainSafe program helps fill those knowledge gaps.”
Grain entrapment is a potentially deadly risk for farmers and others who work around large volumes of grain, and specialized training and equipment are needed to safely extract a victim. 
Just last year a Manitoba farmer trapped in grain was rescued by local firefighters who had received BeGrainSafe training and equipment.
The BeGrainSafe program is supported by the Canadian Agricultural Partnership, G3, Corteva Agriscience, CN, FMC, Agriculture Financial Services Corp., Alberta Canola, Alberta Wheat, Bayer Crop Science,  Canadian Canola Growers Association, FCC, Nutrien Ag Solutions, SaskCanola, Sask Wheat, Viterra, Manitoba Canola Growers, Grain Farmers of Ontario, and Prairie Oat Growers Association.

The event will be held on March 4, from noon to 4 p.m.
Proceeds will benefit Saulteaux and Moosomin First Nations sports and recreation, with a focus on youth programs.
Saulteaux and Moosomin First Nations are hosting the event. Battlefords Agency Tribal Chiefs Inc. (BATC) Community Development Corporation (CDC) is also a part sponsor.
Saulteaux First Nation Chief Kenny Moccasin is one of the organizers and co-founders of the derby, now in its seventh year.
“All the money fundraised goes towards the youth. It’s supporting our youth in sports, and promoting healthy lifestyles,” he said.
Registration starts at 9 a.m. on the day of the event. People can also purchase tickets in advance at various participating locations, including Leisure Time Sports Excellence in North Battleford, and directly through the organizers. There is an early bird buy for those who purchase their tickets before March 2. 
Holes will be pre-drilled for this catch-and-release fishing derby. 
People will be able to grab a bite to eat at one of the canteens set up during the day. 
“Hopefully, we have nice weather again,” Moccasin said. “It’s open to anyone to come in and win some awesome cash prizes.”
The top prize is $20,000 for the largest fish caught. There will be 10 cash payout prizes on offer, as well as a $1,000 prize each for the first fish and smallest fish caught.
“It’s mostly pike, and they have bourbon,” Moccasin said. “One year we had a bourbon that took first place.” 
He said people come as far as Regina, and northern Saskatchewan to take part, adding that usually about 500 to 600 fishers participate. 
This year the derby will be even bigger, with more opportunities to win.
“Come out. There are some fantastic prizes, cash prizes, to be won,” Moccasin said. “And, it all goes to a good cause.”

In December and January, four delegations made up of trade and technical experts, representatives from the Canadian Grain Commission (CGC), grain farmers, and exporters travelled to 15 countries.
Cereals Canada chief executive Dean Dias said farmers and exporters talked to global customers of Canadian wheat. 
“People were happy to welcome us back and have the opportunity to ask questions face to face,” Dias said. “Over the past two years, our team has done an excellent job presenting the information to our customers in an online-only format but one of our great strengths is building relationships.”
Dias said Canadian agriculture supplies consistent, sustainable, high-quality cereals to help support food security at home and around the globe.
“It felt good to return to be meeting with customers in-person to communicate this message, along with the excellent quality and functionality of this year’s Canadian wheat crop,” he said.
The delegations visited key markets for Canadian wheat, including Asia, Latin America, Europe, Africa, and the Gulf Region to share technical information with buyers, millers, bakers, and processors. 
Cereals Canada vice president of technical services Elaine Sopiwnyk said they repeatedly heard from customers about their satisfaction with this year’s crop.
“We had many comments about the large supply, overall quality, and good gluten functionality and, for durum, the high semolina yield, yellowness, and good processibility,” Sopiwnyk said.
In 2021, Canadian wheat production was reduced due to drought conditions across the prairies. Canada returned to above-average production in 2022 with 34.7 million tonnes of wheat produced. That was an increase of 55 per cent from the previous year. 
Last year’s drought also impacted the protein content of the wheat, which was higher than average. The 2022 crop saw a return to more typical protein content and protein quality across all wheat classes.
Sopiwnyk said it was welcome news for millers and bakers who require consistent quality from year-to-year. 
“Customers work with different qualities and protein levels when using and blending wheats from around the world,” Sopiwnyk said. “Having an expected, consistent level of protein is important to our customers to meet their end-product requirements.” 
In addition to questions about quality and performance, the delegates fielded questions about transportation, sustainability, and food security.
Alberta farmer Jason Lenz participated in missions to Nigeria, Singapore, and UAE trade and technical mission. He said the customers he spoke to wanted to know about the resiliency of the future supply coming from Canada. 
The 2022 New Crop Report is prepared and presented in partnership with the CGC, value chain members, and provincial grower commissions.

Préval AG is owned by Alexandre Donald, and Fabien Fontaine. Their company has more than $720 million in annual sales.

The federal agriculture minister met with representatives from 22 industry associations this week to discuss the creation of the Indo-Pacific Agriculture and Agri-Food Office.
Marie-Claude Bibeau said this represents a $31.8 million investment under the federal government’s new Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS). 
During the meeting, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) discussed the office’s goals of increasing and diversifying Canada’s agriculture and agri-food exports and strengthening trade.
The industry representatives shared their perspectives on market priorities for the region, their international trade goals, and their input on how the new office can support their businesses. 
The feedback will help with the early-stage planning and implementation of the initiative.

Sexsmith producer and head of the Alberta Wheat Commission Greg Sears says as we head into spring, farmers are adjusting their farm business plans in light of the drastic price increases we have seen to key cropping tools such as equipment and fertilizer, and even in land prices relevant to cattle producers.
The February 1 opening application date is the earliest in FarmCash history.
Producers will not receive funds until the new Advance Payments Program year on April 1.

It’s the second time the U.S. has launched a dairy-driven escalation in less than two years.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the new panel has become necessary because Canada has so far refused to take the steps necessary to properly address the first one.
The panel ruled in December 2021 that Canada was indeed violating the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement with the way it was allocating import quotas for U.S. dairy products.
U.S. trade officials and dairy industry advocates say a large share of those quotas were being allocated to processors rather than producers.

A property that includes fescue grasslands, forests, and wetlands near Waterton Lakes National Park in southern Alberta has been purchased by the Nature Conservancy of Canada.
The organization said the 2.5-square kilometre property between the national park and Twin Butte is its newest conservation site in Alberta.
It will become part of the 130-square kilometres of private conservation lands known as the Waterton Park Front, which is now about 75 per cent conserved.
The Nature Conservancy of Canada said the protected area will continue to be used for cattle grazing while being managed in a way that allows nature to thrive.

This according to a recent study conducted by Praxis Consulting Ltd. 
The study, commissioned by CWA following the 2022 show, showed a 31 per cent increase in the overall economic impact since its last assessment, bringing the total contribution to $96.5 million which is up from $73.6 million in 2017.
CWA CEO, Shaun Kindopp said the show is a major economic driver.
“It’s just good to break it down, showcasing how many people are truly affected by exhibition and just how much we bring to the the Regina community and the province,” Kindopp said. “The results of this study are a testament to the growth and success of Agribition.”
The study also highlighted $979,000 in trade show booth sales and livestock sales totaling $2.2 million. 
Kindopp said the study also found CWA generates $17.7 million in government revenue annually, including $8.3 million in federal revenue, $8 million in provincial revenue, and $1.4 million in municipal revenue.
“We’re proud to have such a positive impact on our province and city and look forward to continued growth in the future,” Kindopp said. “It’s a very important show and heading into 2023 we definitely want to carry that momentum and we’re here’s hoping that we can reach $100 million next year.”
Kindopp said it’s a place where business gets done and they want to continue to build on that.
“We’ve got people coming from all over the world year after year and it’s a huge part of who we are. We have such an international following and we’re proud that this is where they want to come and do business,” he said. 
Full financial details from Agribition will be presented at the annual general meeting on April 19.

Democrat Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Sen. Mike Crapo laid out their concerns in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.
The letter said American dairy producers still aren’t getting the access to the Canadian market they’re entitled to under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
It also describes Canada’s planned digital services tax as discriminatory and raises similar concerns about new legislation to regulate online streaming and news.
The senators said this would give preferential treatment to Canadian content and deny U.S. tech companies fair access to the market north of the border.
The letter comes after meetings this week in San Diego between U.S., Canadian and Mexican trade emissaries, as well as the North American Leaders’ Summit in Mexico City earlier this month.

Milk prices in New Brunswick are set to increase by four cents per litre starting Wednesday.
The New Brunswick Farm Products Commission blamed the increase on rising production costs faced by dairy producers and processors.
It said dairy farmers are paying more for feed, machinery and equipment repairs, fuel and oil, custom work and hired labour.
The commission said the price adjustment also covers increased costs borne by dairy processors, including for packaging, manufacturing, transportation, and distribution. 
The commission added farmers will receive 1.7 cents more per litre from the price increase, while processors will get 2.4 cents more per litre.

Animal protection officers with the SPCA have seized 129 cattle from a property in southeastern British Columbia.
The society said the neglected cattle were being housed in substandard conditions on a property in Cawston, B.C., with no access to shelter or protection from the elements.
The society’s Eileen Drever said the cows did not have adequate food or drinking water and were struggling to move through the mud.
They were also suffering from a range of medical issues, including untreated eye infections, lameness, inflamed udders, overgrown hoofs and diarrhea.
Numerous carcasses of dead cows were also discovered on the property.
The surviving animals are currently in the care of the provincial SPCA and charges of animal cruelty are being recommended.

Early detection of infectious diseases in chickens and developing regional influenza vaccines for pigs are among 28 livestock and forage-related research.
In all, 25 USask researchers were awarded funding for projects that range from using artificial intelligence to monitor the well-being of pigs to developing vaccines to control diseases. These diseases range from foot rot in cattle to controlling microbial diseases in bees and maximizing the use of wheat straw in the diet of beef cattle. 
Five of these projects, totaling $863,000, are at the USask-owned Prairie Swine Centre. 
The money comes from Saskatchewan’s Agriculture Development Fund (ADF), a program jointly funded by the provincial and federal governments. 
The announcement was made during the Beef Industry Symposium held in Saskatoon, Sask. this week.

Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit said producers leasing Crown grazing land will be eligible for rent reductions if they are forced to move cattle due to dry conditions during the grazing season.
“If some of the pasture patrons and leaseholders, whether it’s on Crown land, private lease or community pasture, if they pull some animals off, then we will cut the lease rate by that number, up to a maximum of 50 per cent,” Marit said.
Saskatchewan’s livestock sector is facing increasing costs of production in addition to successive years of low precipitation in many areas of the province, according to Marit. 
“Keeping this year’s grazing rate at 2022 levels and implementing reductions for Crown grazing lands hardest hit by drought, will assist producers through the current challenges while supporting the continued stewardship and productivity of the land,” he said.
Saskatchewan’s Crown grazing rates are established annually using a formula based on fall cattle prices and the long-term stocking rate of each parcel of land. This year’s rate freeze will apply to all grazing leases across the province.
The 2023 rate reduction will match the reduction in carrying capacity, ranging from a 20 per cent rate reduction up to a maximum of 50 per cent.
Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association Chair Arnold Balicki said it is something many ranchers have been calling for.
“We appreciate the responsiveness of this government, and the pragmatic approach taken with today’s announcement shows a real interest in supporting our livestock industry in the face of ongoing challenges,” Balicki said.
The announcement was made at the Saskatchewan Beef Industry Conference in Saskatoon this morning.

Prince Edward Island potato farmers said a new report on potato wart shows the 2021 decision to halt exports to the United States went too far, and they want remaining restrictions lifted for farms where the soil-borne fungus has not been found.
The report from the International Advisory Panel on Potato Wart submitted to the federal government last week found that while potato wart has been identified in clusters, most of P.E.I. is considered a pest-free area.
P.E.I. Potato Board chair John Visser said the panel’s report shows that Canada’s restrictions to manage potato wart have been an overreach.
The disease disfigures potatoes but poses no threat to human health, spreads through the movement of infected potatoes, soil and farm equipment.
Canada stopped sending the Island’s best-known export to the U.S. on Nov. 21, 2021, after the fungus was detected in a few fields on the Island. Shipments resumed in April 2022 after the U.S. Department of Agriculture gave Island farms the all-clear.
Visser said he and his peers were offended by the 2021 ministerial order that said the province was infested with potato wart when in fact only a handful of fields had the fungus.

Chuck Penner with Leftfield Commodity Research told those gathered at the recent Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission (Sask Flax) annual meeting that he didn’t have much in the way of good news for flax producers.
Penner said Canadian farmers have fallen out of love with the oilseed crop and that has meant lower flax acreage.
“I really like flax. I think it has lots of potential, but the biggest difficulty for flax is the increase in production in places like Russia and Kazakhstan, where it used to be the Canadian flax crop would set the tone for global markets because we dominated the trade,” Penner said. “Now the size of the crop in that part of the world is three or four times the size of the Canadian crop. We’ve had trouble exporting to China and Europe because those other two countries are supplying it at lower prices.”
As Saskatchewan flax acres have declined in recent years, this has had a negative impact on revenue for the flax commission.
Sask Flax board chair Gregory Sundquist said the loss of revenue and the departure of executive director Wayne Thompson has forced them to make some tough decisions.
Sundquist said SaskFlax had already announced it has entered into a new management collaboration with the Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission (SaskCanola).
Two resolutions were passed at the annual meeting. Sundquist said the first resolution stated Sask Canola would assume the mandate of the flax commission to carry out research, advocacy, market development, grower relations and communication activities for flax.
“Sask Canola made us an offer to assist us with our administrative needs as a commission because our budget is decreasing as our production and exports go down,” Sundquist said. “At the same time, we had our executive director take a different position, so we needed both support and an executive director role, but also we needed the support in administration, bookkeeping, communications, and some agronomy.”
Sundquist said the second resolution stated Sask Flax will seek input throughout the year on restructuring the flax levy to a percentage-based system of 0.5 per cent of gross sales, effective Aug. 1, 2024.
“Currently, our levy is $2.36 per tonne and as our tonnage goes down that has a major impact on the income that we receive,” Sundquist said. “Prices have moved down quite a bit so if we go to a percentage-based levy system, we have the ability to reflect the value of flax and that value of flax will also determine the amount of income that comes to the commission.”
Sundquist pointed out the resolutions are taken under advisement and will be the starting point of conversations with levy producers this year.
“Especially on something as important as a levy increase, we have to work with our levy payers to find out if they think it’s appropriate or if they don’t, and what’s the appropriate level of that percentage of levy,” he said. 
Sundquist said even with the challenges he believes flax is a good crop option for growers.
“Flax has a good net return. It’s a little cheaper to grow and there’s some great varieties coming out. I’ve talked to people that have had over 40 bushels an acre this year. It returned some pretty good money,” he said. “There’s issues with flax straw, I understand, but it’s a good crop for rotation. If we can increase the demand, I think it’ll be very profitable crop for Saskatchewan farmers.”
The canola and flax levies from producers will continue to be collected separately and SaskCanola and SaskFlax will maintain individual Board of Directors, as well as separate governance structures, according to Sundquist.
“There’s been no discussion about a merger at this point in time, we will remain separate as far as our boards, collecting separate levies but who knows, in the future, what we will find out as we go through this year and discuss things with our levy producers.

CCAW is a new not-for-profit organization that launched on Nov. 7. It supports farmers and their families with a research-to-action approach to mental health. 
From floods to pandemics and supply chain disruptions, farmers face many uncontrollable and unforeseen events that can impact their mental health. These types of events often result in higher-than-average rates of stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues among farmers. 
According to the 2019 Report of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, 45 per cent of farmers reported high-stress levels, and 45 per cent indicated they would not reach out for help if they were in need, due to the stigma around mental health.
TELUS Health will be the exclusive clinical and technology provider for Canadian farmers who are facing catastrophic events, as well as for farmers who don’t have access to provincial and federal programming.
CCAW CEO and Lead Scientist Dr. Briana Hagen said collaborating with TELUS Health will mean services will get to people when they need them most.
“It means that we have the infrastructure to provide clinical support and much-needed technology for education and community programs to support the wellbeing of farmers and the agricultural community across Canada,” Hagen said.
Hagen is part of the CCAW’s all-women leadership team working with TELUS Health, and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, to connect all Canadian farmers and the greater agriculture community to farmer-centered mental health resources, support, and information, primarily with a grassroots approach.
TELUS Health Chief Operating Officer Michael Dingle said the company jumped at the opportunity to work with the CCAW to help develop a support program and services for farmers.
“Not only when a major crisis or natural disaster hits but whenever they need access to counselling and care. TELUS Health’s expertise in health, agriculture, and digital infrastructure allow us to provide far-reaching support to the hard-working Canadian farmers and families who work to put food on our tables every day,” Dingle said.

The governments of Saskatchewan and Alberta and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) are partnering to remove barriers to interprovincial food trade in Lloydminster. 
As a city split by the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, food trade issues have been a concern there for years. 
The two-year pilot is aiming to take steps toward a solution that could help Lloydminster and similar border towns throughout Canada. 
On Jan. 16, CFIA published a notice of intent to amend the Safe Food for Canadians Regulations to address Lloydminster’s unique situation. 
The pilot, administered by the Lloydminster Chamber of Commerce, will ease the challenges faced by food businesses in Saskatchewan and Alberta for trade into all of the city of Lloydminster. 
To trade interprovincially, even within the city of Lloydminster, food businesses must comply with the provisions of the Safe Food for Canadians Act and its regulations. 
Under the pilot program, the regulations and provisions will still be in effect when food is transported in and out of the province, essentially treating the city as if it were located within a single province. 
Information on the pilot can be found here.

The organization named 10-year-old Reise Podordeski of Marcelin the new Whole Hog Youth Ambassador.
Podordeski will be involved in the creation of a series of videos that will focus on basic consumer questions and some of the things he has learned along the way.
He will also attend various events across the province on behalf of Sask Pork. 
“I’m really excited to be the first representative of Sask Pork’s Whole Hog Youth Ambassador program,” Podordeski said. “I can’t wait to show everyone what I’ve seen and experienced so far. It’s a great way to show other kids and everyone across Saskatchewan what it’s really like to be a pig farmer.” 
Podordeski lives on his family’s commercial hay farm. He first learned about the pork industry from his grandparents and his father once ran a genetic female nucleus.
“We have horses and I have been involved in 4-H and I get to help with lots of things around the yard. My dad’s family raised pigs when he was growing up and I’ve heard lots of stories from him and my Nana,” he said.
Podordeski said it’s important for people to be more aware of where their food comes from, and it will give young people an opportunity to learn about the pork industry from someone close to their own age.
“My role as a youth ambassador is to learn first by asking questions of people who work in the industry and then share what I’ve learned,” he said. “I really want to share how much farmers care for their pigs.”
Sask Pork General Manager Mark Ferguson said Podordeski will be a great representative for the organization.
“Reise brings a natural curiosity and a keen interest in the hog industry to the role,” Ferguson said. “The Whole Hog program is a great opportunity to bring a youthful energy to the industry and create engaging and education material.”
The Whole Hog videos will be released on the Sask Pork and Pick Pork social media channels and featured on the Sask Pork website.

Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities (SARM) president Ray Orb said the act will protect law-abiding firearm owners.
“This legislation is another tool to help the people of rural Saskatchewan insulate ourselves from misguided federal policies. SARM is a strong advocate for responsible and safe firearm ownership,” Orb said in a news release. “The provincial plan is more practical and is more in line with the needs of rural Saskatchewan. Establishing Saskatchewan-based criteria for responsible firearms ownership is much preferred over the federal government setting the requirements.”
Orb said concerns are growing over the federal gun bans, and SARM members are concerned these are ineffective and politically motivated infringements on the rights and freedoms of farmers, ranchers, and recreational firearm users.
The Saskatchewan Firearms Act will also establish a provincial firearms regulatory system that will promote the safe use of firearms, according to Orb.
“The Saskatchewan Firearms Office is a great resource to promote firearm safety messages and support ongoing safety and education initiatives,” he said.

A new fertilizer efficiency calculator tool was launched at Manitoba Ag Days.
Agriculture Minister Derek Johnson said the calculator uses field-specific soil test results and science-based analysis to provide application recommendations.
The calculator compares a producer’s fertilizer plans to the most- and least-efficient fertilizer application cost per acre and net profit per acre. 
It also provides a user-friendly dashboard score for cost efficiency, greenhouse gas efficiency, maximum profitability, and maximum yield.
The Excel version of the calculator is available on the Manitoba Agriculture website.
A mobile-friendly, web-based version is in development.

The Saskatchewan government and SaskPork are investing $1 million in preparation for a possible outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF).
Agriculture Minister David Marit said responding to animal diseases is critical to supporting the Saskatchewan swine industry.
“This funding will support a healthy hog sector and protect hog producers and abattoirs during potential market disruptions,” Marit said. 
The funding will support the creation of a cull line at the sow processing facility Donald’s Fine Foods is constructing in Moose Jaw.  It would allow for humane slaughter of domestic hogs if a serious swine disease outbreak ever temporarily stopped trade.
ASF is a viral disease that only impacts pigs. To date, ASF has never been detected in Canada.

They face both systemic and attitudinal barriers to entering the industry and securing leadership positions. 
This constrains the sector’s capacity, resiliency, and innovation; creates challenges in attracting and retaining women; and negatively affects the sector’s public image.
The Engaging and Advancing Women in Agriculture (EAWA) project is led by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture (CFA) which is continuing the work done by the Prince Edward Island Federation of Agriculture (PEIFA) and Karolyn Godfrey of Winding Path Inc.
The earlier work was developed in consultation with a working group of female agricultural leaders with a strategic plan focused on the implementation of policies and programs to address barriers to women’s full participation in the sector. 
The EAWA project is implementing the strategic plan in PEI with the hope of adopting similar approaches from other producer associations across Canada.
CFA President Mary Robinson said they are committed to supporting greater diversity in the agricultural sector.
“We are excited to have the opportunity to lead the EAWA project which will both celebrate the women leaders in our sector and help to reduce the systemic barriers women face in getting involved,” Robinson said. “Any person with an interest in a career in agriculture should be welcomed and encouraged to contribute. It’s time to level the field.”
The project will develop, pilot, and document a framework that producer associations can use to address the underrepresentation of women in Canadian agriculture, support women in the sector to develop skills to take on greater leadership roles, and raise awareness of the benefits of women’s full participation, all while addressing those barriers.
The project is funded in part by the federal government under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership’s AgriDiversity Program, the Chicken Farmers of Canada, and PEIFA.

The farewell gathering was held at the Seniors Activity Centre in Meadow Lake Tuesday afternoon.
Cubbon, 67, spent close to 10 years at the Meadow Lake Co-op in the agricultural department and as part of the newly named Grow Team. He has also worked for over 40 years as a well known agronomist and ag industry advisor in the Meadow Lake area and across the Prairies. Before working for the Co-op, Cubbon was employed by the province for many years in the agricultural field.
Originally from North Battleford, Cubbon first moved to the Meadow Lake area in 1985, and eventually went on to work at the Co-op around 2013.
He said he is looking forward to heading into the next chapter of his life now that he is retiring, and plans to spend more time with family and his grandchildren.
“It was time,” Cubbon said. “I had certain things I wanted to do at the Co-op, and I’ve got them accomplished. Now it’s time to do something else.” 
He plans to stay in Meadow Lake with his wife, a retired teacher. The couple have four kids, two of whom are also pursuing careers in agriculture. 
During his work as an agronomist with the Meadow Lake Co-op, Cubbon enjoyed offering advice to producers purchasing products to use on their farms.   
“People we do business with, that’s their livelihood,” he said. “So, we provide services and products to them to do their business.”
Cubbon said he has loved his work in agriculture over the years, using his expertise to help others, and being involved with the Co-op. 
“I like working with people and I like being in the country, and that’s what I did,” he said. “Part of what I did was trying to show people new technology and how to be profitable in their business. You had to understand all that.” 
Cubbon added that working at the Co-op also allowed him the opportunity to see a variety of things done in the ag sector around the Meadow Lake area.  
“I wanted to train a number of people, the staff, to help them understand agriculture, as I’ve seen it over the years in Meadow Lake,” he said. “That was the big priority. And we wanted to set up a field-scouting program and a few other programs, and they [the Co-op] allowed me to do that.”
As part of the field-scouting program, experts go out to farmers’ fields, and make observations, while taking soil and tissue samples. Then, they can make recommendations to help farmers deal with any issues they may have during the growing season, and ultimately improve farmers’ crop production and make them more profitable.  
“We have a good group of young staff now, and there is a field-scouting program [established], and some other services that have been expanded,” Cubbon said. “It’s pretty much to the point where the things I initially wanted to get done are in place there now. So, it’s great.”  
Cubbon’s daughter, Jackie, is also one of the agronomists at the Co-op now, keeping the family tradition going strong.
Cubbon said the Meadow Lake Co-op has always been involved in the agricultural community, providing a range of services and products to farmers.
He added the Meadow Lake Co-op Fertilizer Plant, which was started around nine years ago, has also been a great addition to the farming community over the years to meet area farmers’ needs. 
Curtis Ebach, Meadow Lake Co-op ag division manager, said Cubbon will be missed.
“He was a huge part of our team,” Ebach said. “He was our senior agronomist, and he trained our young agronomists to be what they are today. He was a big part of our business.”

Saskatchewan is getting involved in a B.C. court case.
The provincial government said it is joining Manitoba in seeking leave in Federal Court to intervene in a judicial review of the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority’s new gateway infrastructure fees.
The new fees that took effect Jan. 1 range from eight to 40 cents per tonne for bulk, non-containerized cargo such as potash and grain, two of Saskatchewan’s biggest exports.
Saskatchewan Justice Minister Bronwyn Eyre said the province depends heavily on exports, and the fees could significantly increase costs for Saskatchewan goods moving through the Port.
Parrish & Heimbecker CEO John Heimbecker said a significant portion of those costs will inevitably be borne by prairie grain farmers.

Bacon has been a champion of positioning pulses as an affordable, nutritious, and healthy food. He has focused on sustainable cropping systems and reducing the ecological footprint of pulse production. 
Bacon served as the CEO for Pulse Canada for 24 years, from 1997 to 2021, and was CEO of Canadian Special Crops Association (CSCA), for 16 years.
As part of a national and global pulse leadership group, Bacon worked to have the United Nations (UN) declare 2016 as International Year of Pulses and a UN designation of World Pulses Day each year in February. 
Canada’s pulse industry is positioned to be the leader in health, nutrition, and environmental sustainability but that opportunity must be co-created with the food sector,” according to Bacon.
“The necessity for dietary change in order to feed 10 billion is an important opportunity for pulses. This isn’t just about farmers and the markets we have today, this is about consumption and influencing the social drivers of change,” Bacon said. “We need to be a part of the things that are already shaping the future of food. The opportunities lie within the matrix of being efficient and being transformative.”
Prior to joining Canada’s pulse industry, Bacon was director of market development at the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB). He also served as senior policy advisor to a federal cabinet minister in Ottawa, as well as various roles with federal and provincial departments of agriculture. 
He has been an active member of the executive of the Global Pulse Confederation (GPC) since 2001 and is now the GPC director of Food Systems. 
The Pulse Promoter Award recognizes individuals who have made a significant contribution to the development of Saskatchewan’s pulse industry in the areas of production, marketing, promotion, research, extension, processing, management, and/or innovation.

A new HyLife weaning ramp has the potential to improve animal care across the industry.
The ramp was created by the Continuous Improvement Team (CI), a group of engineers dedicated to solving challenges while improving animal welfare. 
After listening to farm employees, it was discovered that picking up piglets and bringing them to the employee performing vaccination placed a strain on both the staff and animals. 
HyLife Senior Vice President of Farms Division Lyle Loewen said the company knew there was a better way. 
“We prioritize animal care and lean on our in-house experts and CI team to develop a creative solution. The result is a ramp that eliminates the need to pick up piglets” he said. “This means less stress and more safety for both our animals and employees.”
The piglets enter an alleyway and towards the ramp in groups. Once up the ramp, a gate using a pulley system is lowered. Employees can easily begin picking the piglets from waist height to be vaccinated. Gradual sloping slides, off each side of the station, bring the piglet back down slowly and safely to ground level. 
The HyLife weaning ramp won an innovation award at the 2023 Banff Pork Seminar. It has also been praised by renowned animal behavioralist Dr. Temple Grandin.

Drysdale planted the crop on a whim; to have a beautiful backdrop to the Prairie sunsets during the long summer hours and to keep awareness of the war overseas, having large signage off Highway 43X near the traffic circle reading “Shoulder to shoulder with the people of Ukraine” with the flag of the country behind the quote.

He says the community support from helping grow the crop, to getting it cleaned and bagged, and onto shelves has been tremendous. 
“It’s grown into a really good, worthy cause, and just huge support from everybody around. I look forward to getting the seeds sold and getting the funds to the Rotary Club of Grande Prairie.”
The bags can be purchased for $50 per bag at: 
All the proceeds from the sales of the 33-pound bags of black sunflower bird seeds will go directly to the GP Rotary Ukrainian Relief Fund. 
Drysdale says the field was finally ready to be taken off in December, due to harvest conditions being too nice in the fall of 2022 and the region not getting the first cold snap and frost before snow hit the ground.

The sunflowers seeds were cleaned by Wembley Seed Cleaning Plant and bagged and palleted by Fosters Seed and Feed in Beaverlodge, free of charge for the cause. 
Drysdale says there were a number of people and businesses that have helped him in his first venture with the crop from seeding to selling, including local beekeeper Steve Strebchuk bringing hives to the field in the summer, SpeedPro Wes for signage, as well as the Rotary Club of Grande Prairie for identifying refugee families in the area for all the proceeds to go towards.

Do More Ag wants to identify gaps in mental health resources for the industry, specifically the gaps that exist for women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, 2SLGBTQI+, persons with disabilities, and from racialized communities. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said Do More Ag plays an important role in helping to bring the unique mental health challenges facing producers and their families to light.
“This collaborative project serves to boost necessary mental health resources for underrepresented and marginalized groups. We will continue to support projects that improve mental well-being and work towards inclusivity in agriculture,” Bibeau said. 
Executive Director Megz Reynolds said they want to change the culture in agriculture to one where all individuals are supported and empowered to take care of their mental well-being.
“We must also create an industry where all are welcome, lifted up and the specific needs of each individual and group are addressed,” Reynolds said. “I am very thankful for Minister Bibeau’s support through AgriDiversity and for the incredible individuals involved in this project. Their openness to share and their willingness to have the hard conversations are vital to creating change.” 
Do More Ag is collaborating with Wilton Consulting Group (WCG), Openly, and Ontario Psychotherapist and Registered Social Worker Bonnie Taylor to conduct, workshops, environmental scans, interviews, surveys, and focus groups. 
Taylor is serving as the Farmer Mental Health Expert Advisor for this project. 
“I am excited to be a part of this project with Do More Ag, as I understand the unique needs and stressors of farmers and producers,” Taylor said. “I recognize the importance of creating an accessible and unique mental health support system to foster positive mental health, reduce stress, and improve overall mental health. This project will serve as an important step in that journey.” 
This project is funded up to $76,000 in part by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada under the Canadian Agricultural Partnership’s AgriDiversity Program.
The final report will be released in the second quarter of 2023.

The Agriculture Development Fund (ADF) provides the money needed for basic and applied agriculture research in crops, livestock, forages, processing, soils, environment, horticulture, and alternative crops.
Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister David Marit said $10.3 million would go towards 49 research projects.
Some examples include exploring the diversity of Fusarium root to species infecting pulse crops, insect response to climate change and ag inputs across the prairies, and a nutritionally balanced pulse-oilseed protein-based beverage.
Encouraging this kind of research and innovation is the first step to staying competitive but these projects take money and time, according to Marit.
“Let’s face it, you can’t do some of this plant research in one year or two years, it usually takes three or four years to develop and design,” Marit said. “That’s why we invest in this because it makes good sense when you can increase production on pulses or look after disease control in pulses or increase cereal production or oil content.”
University of Saskatchewan’s Crop Development Centre (CDC) will receive $7.2 million in operational support over the next five years.
CDC Director Dr. Curtis Pozniak said the contribution will support the work of eight crop development centre breeders and scientists as well as 80 to 100 research graduates, students, and other support staff.
“I think it’s important that having these sorts of resources to fund the center helps support the scientists that train students, to support the breeding programs, the pathology programs, so that they function well,” Pozniak said. “That attracts students from all over the world to come and train here as graduate students, masters, and PhD level. But it also supports developments of ideas that we can then bring into training the next generation of scientists.”
This annual investment helps generate new knowledge, information and technologies for producers and food processors, such as feed and nutrition information for ranchers and new crop cultivars and production information for farmers.
An additional $4.6 million came from Alberta Wheat and Barley, Alberta Canola, Manitoba Crop Alliance, Manitoba Canola, Sask Barley, Sask Canola, Saskatchewan Forage Seed Development Commission, Prairie Oat Growers, Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association, Saskatchewan Pulse Growers, Sask Wheat and the Western Grains Research Foundation.
The full list of funded projects can be found here.

Bill Huber from Lipton has represented many agriculture programs across Canada and the United States. He was president of the Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association from 2017 to 2020. Prior to that, he was also on the executive of the Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association.
“I had the privilege of sitting on that board for a couple of years, I was involved in an inland terminal that we built and that was a big part of my life and I’ve been an RM counselor for 11 years and on the SARM board for the seven years,” Huber said.
He and his wife, Jan, have hosted numerous field days on their farm for farmers all over the world.
Kevin Hursh is known as the “trusted voice of agriculture.” As a journalist, Hursh revolutionized agriculture and farm reporting in the province as host of ‘Farmgate’ with CTV Saskatchewan. He said when he got started rural residents didn’t have the multitude of channels they have now.
“People out in rural areas had two or maybe three channels. We had a big share back in those days. We had a lot of people working in ag within the CTV network so that we could do a lot of things,” Hursh said.
Hursh shares his knowledge through consulting and remains the go-to media and communications person for many agricultural industry organizations.
Also going into the Ag Hall of Fame is Dorothy Long of Lloydminster. Long’s background in home economics helped to advance consumer knowledge of food and farming. Long said she focused on teaching.
“The most intimate way that consumers come to agriculture is through the food they eat and that’s where the questions start,” Long said. “That’s where we have to start with our messaging to have a conversation with them.”
Long has been instrumental in organizing and guiding farm tours for dietitians, journalists, and food writers with the goal of connecting rural and urban residents. 
The fourth Ag Hall of Fame inductee is John McKinnon from the University of Saskatchewan. McKinnon started his career as a beef specialist and was an expert in beef nutrition. With a PhD in animal science, much of his research focused on the use of by-products. Throughout his career, his projects continually worked to improve efficiencies or lower production costs. 
He said entering the ag hall of fame is a major achievement.
“You know, I get to think of some of the people that I’ve worked with over the years and particularly Red Williams, Dave Christianson, and Vern Racz and it’s certainly an honor to join them in the hall,” he said.
McKinnon was also one of the founders of the Western Canadian Feedlot Management School. 
Laurie Tollefson spent four decades working at the Irrigation Centre in Outlook. He recently retired as a director.
Tollefson said the research benefitted not only farmers in the Lake Diefenbaker region but those from as far away as Africa.
“The technology we offered wasn’t necessarily rocket science but in places like Egypt it was a basic tenant of soil and water individuals were interested in and we would give courses,” Tollefson said.
He is one of the few Canadians to hold the position of vice president of the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage and he was instrumental in bringing the International Conference on Irrigation and Drainage to the province.
Bill Huber, Kevin Hursh, Dorothy Long, John McKinnon, and Laurie Tollefson will be inducted into the Saskatchewan Agricultural Hall of Fame during a ceremony on Apr. 15 at Saskatoon Prairieland Park.

A total of 205 canola fields were surveyed in the major canola production regions of Saskatchewan last year. 
The survey covered 29 fields in the northwest, 32 fields in the northeast, west-central region surveyed 28 fields, east-central has 52 fields checked, southwest had 27 fields and there were 37 fields in the southeast. 
Due to the random and permission-based nature of field selection, not every rural municipality (RM) was surveyed in each region, while multiple fields were surveyed in some RMs.
Disease assessments were made by collecting 20 plants from five different sites, each at least 30 meters from the edge of the field. 
Sclerotinia stem rot was found in 56 per cent of the crops surveyed. 
Average incidence across all crops surveyed in the province was six per cent and was higher than in 2021, but lower than 2020. 
Higher disease incidence in 2022 can be attributed to the weather during the growing season.

The John Deere dealership was built on 30 acres of land east of the community on Highway Five.
Pattison Agriculture president Doug Tibben said it is an impressive building.
“This new facility is around 52,000 square feet and it represents a fairly substantial investment in the community and the Pattison Group is very excited to be part of that,” Tibben said.
There are currently 35 employees at the Humboldt location, but that could increase in the future, according to Tibben.
“We plan to continue to expand and grow so we will be looking for more employees as we build our business here and we rely on the Humboldt community to support that,” he said.
Branch Manager Wade Prouse said what makes the facility unique is its large, 24,000 square-foot shop, 3,000 square-foot wash bay attached to the main service building, three overhead cranes, and bright lighting. He said it will increase efficiency.
“Previously, we really only had one door that would allow us to get the biggest combines in and now we’ve got 18 bays. Each one of them can service even the largest machines,” Prouse told farmnewsNOW. “It will help us get equipment ready, not only going to the field for the first time but also to keep people running and get them up and going faster.”
Prouse said they already have high-quality service technicians, but he believes as the company grows, they will be able to attract more specialists.
“Having a new facility helps us get more technicians, this will be the place that they’ll want to work,” Prouse said. “It’s brand new, it’s bright in here, we’ve got crane coverage for the entire building and it’s just a great environment to work in. That will help us get more technicians to get more equipment running faster.”
Jim Pattison told the gathering the focus is always on the customer.
“The customer is always our number one priority,” he said. “We want to do everything we can in this company to serve our customers, no matter if it’s little or big, it’s our job to look after you.”
Pattison Agriculture was formed in January 2017 through the merger of JayDee AgTech and Maple Farm Equipment. 
There are 12 locations in Saskatchewan and two in Manitoba.

Harold Martens served on the SCA board, on behalf of the Saskatchewan Stock Growers Association (SSGA) for over six years. He represented the SCA on several boards, including the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and Livestock Services of Saskatchewan. 
SCA Chair Arnold Balicki said Martens was a staunch defender of Saskatchewan’s cattle producers.
“His extensive knowledge provided important contributions to the conversation around the current and future state of our industry,” Balicki said.
Martens was reeve of the R.M. of Excelsior, agriculture minister in the Devine government, and served as deputy opposition leader.
He retired from politics to return to ranching, and later served as president of the Saskatchewan Stock Growers from 2011 to 2014.
Martens was 81.

Graig Whitehead works for the fertilizer division with Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM). Primarily, he said the company acts as an import and export commodity trader that specializes in risk-management logistics and distribution.
The company also has wholesale and retail arms.
Whitehead said the company works to connect fertilizer with futures and paper trading, similar to how the grain business operates. He added the company’s commitment to transparent market pricing brings “above-average traffic” to its booth regularly.
“We bring a lot of information to the farmers that they might otherwise find difficult to get,” Whitehead said.
In his second visit to the Western Canadian Crop Show since COVID-19 hit, Whitehead said he’s anticipating a lot of conversations at the booth centred around the Canadian government’s intent to cut carbon emissions through restrictions on fertilizer.
“My understanding is that the Canadian government has a lot of refining in the legislation yet to do,” he said, noting ADM’s stance on the issue has yet to be seen, given that no decision has been made yet.
Whitehead did note that it’s an issue that the company is certainly aware of.
“If a reduction becomes mandated, that will affect the customers’ business, which will ultimately affect our business,” he explained.
With appropriate notice, should any changes be made by the government, Whitehead said ADM would certainly be able to adjust as needed. The situation, however, remains unknown.
That uncertainty is what Whitehead thinks will be top of mind for fertilizer-minded visitors in the next few days.
“I expect a lot of those discussions,” Whitehead said, anticipating farmers will wonder about ADM’s opinions.
“We don’t necessarily have a stance. We’re not a urea or a nitrogen or a fertilizer manufacturer so we don’t have that vested interest in maintaining that level of production. But at the same time, it is the core of our business too.”
Mario Gaudet said making the most efficient use of nutrients through high-efficiency fertilizers, accessing already-present nutrients through soil conditioners and using environmentally friendly fertilizer stabilizers is the focus of Timac Agro Canada.
He said some of Timac’s products do fall into the initiatives being considered by the federal government currently.
The company’s Excelis Maxx is “a big topic of discussion right now with the federal government’s initiative to reduce NO2 and nitrogen emissions,” Gaudet said.
The idea, he explained, is to keep more nitrogen in the soil to get better and more efficient use from it.
“It’s still applicable regardless of any program. There’s still value on a farm to grow your margins, to grow your farm (and) to make better use,” Gaudet said.

The 2023 Saskatchewan Clubroot Distribution Map outlined the rural municipalities where clubroot has been identified. 
Clubroot is a soil-borne disease that can cause significant yield loss when pathogen levels are high, a susceptible crop is grown and when environmental conditions are favourable. 
Over 500 fields were inspected as part of the clubroot monitoring program. In total, 39 soil samples were submitted for laboratory analysis and SaskCanola covered the cost of each test.
Visible clubroot symptoms were recorded in two more commercial canola fields and the clubroot pathogen was detected in four new fields. Clubroot symptoms have been confirmed in 82 commercial fields while the clubroot pathogen has been detected through DNA-based testing in 42 fields where there were no visible symptoms. 
Agriculture Minister David Marit said the results show the importance of continuing to monitor and manage clubroot.
“Clubroot can impact our producers, landowners and the province’s strong canola market,” Marit said. “This map helps the ministry to track and manage clubroot while preventing it from reaching other fields.”
All producers with visible clubroot symptoms or fields with the presence of the pathogen have been notified. The specific land locations are kept confidential and not shared publicly to protect the producer’s privacy. 
Land locations are only shared with the appropriate RM if they have clubroot-specific bylaws enacted and visible symptoms have been confirmed.
SaskCanola Research Committee Keith Fournier said the organization funds province-wide disease testing to ensure a good understanding of the regions where the disease is present. 
“This way canola growers can make the best management decisions for their farm to prevent the spread of this invasive soil-borne disease,” Fournier said.
The Ministry of Agriculture, SaskCanola, Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation and plant health officers, implemented the clubroot monitoring program to understand the distribution and severity of the disease in the province and where it has been already detected. 
The program includes in-field surveillance, free on-farm soil DNA testing for producers and agrologists and encouraging clubroot reporting from producers and industry.

As the use of AI grows, so does the need for support in its adoption and use. 
Protein Industries Canada (PIC) is opening another round of Expressions of Interest for its Artificial Intelligence Program.
The program was launched last fall with a focus on working with agrifood companies to support them in developing AI technology for use in their businesses. 
Protein Industries Canada CEO Bill Greuel said the program’s first round of applications saw a steady flow of intake, and projects are currently under review for approval.
“Artificial intelligence technology has the potential to make our sector more efficient and more sustainable,” Greuel said. “As companies across Canada look towards how they can incorporate new forms of this valuable technology into their toolkits, it’s important they have the knowledge, skills, and support in place that helps them adopt and implement it properly.”
Gruel said with the proper data strategies and partners in place, companies can use AI to address challenges related to ingredient development, processing, and recipe formulation.
PIC will close this latest round of intakes on Feb. 15.
Information on how to apply is available here.

Researchers from the University of Saskatchewan have been using a common agriculture byproduct to treat wastewater contaminated by antibiotics and other pharmaceutical chemicals.
The study found flax shives that have been treated with heat and steam adsorb the medication carbamazepine from wastewater. Flax shives are the material left after fibre is extracted from flax stems.
Researcher Catherine Niu said there are many agricultural byproducts generated that are not effectively used. She said by creating absorbents that are inexpensive and easily accessible they can attract the attention of businesses looking for more efficient ways to treat wastewater.

This year’s edition will go Friday and Saturday at Evergreen Park
Congress president Colby Klassen says organizers are excited to be able to have the event again.
“The biggest thing is marketing. We hope to get the commercial producers to come in and look at, say, our bulls, our heifers that the purebred producers have in here. The whole marketing thing is probably about half of what the show does.”
“The other half that we do is really focused on the junior side of things, getting these young kids that are in 4-H or these junior clubs to get involved.”
He adds a lot of people will be taking part. 
“The exhibitors, I think we got just about 30 exhibitors coming and I think there’s a pretty good group of cattle. There should be about 80 head in total here.”
“On Friday morning we’ll see a pretty large group of junior kids.”
Klassen expects about 100 kids to take part in a grooming clinic. There will also be 13 vendors in a trade show. 
The show is taking place at Evergreen Park this year after the last several editions were held in Dawson Creek. Klassen says the congress was intended to be a traveling show and they are hoping to reach a different group of people this time around.
He adds everything gets going Friday morning at 9 a.m.
“There’ll be a junior steer and heifer show later in the afternoon, I believe it’s at 3 and 4 (p.m.). We’ll have a banquet supper at 6 and then at 7, we actually have a new thing to this year’s show. It’s a junior show team competition.”
“What that is is just to get kids more involved in judging and being a ringman for these shows.”
Saturday’s activities start at 10 a.m. Klassen expects them to go around 4:30 in the afternoon. 
The cattle are being housed in the Drysdale Centre and the activities are in the Lewis Hawkes Pavilion. 
Klassen says the show coincides with calving time for a lot of purebred cattle operations.
“Yeah, that’s the one tricky part for lots of purebred breeders is they have to sacrifice a little bit. Probably a little bit why we don’t get quite as many numbers sometimes because some of the guys are just too busy with calving to be able to get out to the event.”
Klassen says calving has gone well with the warmer weather the region has had lately.

The Saskatchewan Canola Development Commission (SaskCanola) and the Saskatchewan Flax Development Commission (SaskFlax) will operate out of one office in Saskatoon, Sask.
Oilseed production in Saskatchewan has grown significantly over the past 30 years. SaskFlax board chair Greg Sundquist said finding administrative and operational efficiencies ensures that growers’ levy dollars are put to the best use.
“Our commissions were created with similar mandates and key focus areas – research, extension and market development. We are excited about the opportunities this arrangement brings to oilseed growers,” Sundquist said. 
SaskCanola Board Chair Charlene Bradley said it’s important to have a strong voice speaking on behalf of all Saskatchewan growers by conveying a clear message. 
“A lot of flax growers in our province are also going to have canola in their rotation, so it makes sense,” Bradley said.
Canola and flax levies will continue to be collected separately. SaskCanola and SaskFlax will maintain individual boards of directors and separate governance structures.

A key lesson learned from the European African Swine Fever experience has been the value of advanced rather than reactionary planning for dealing with an outbreak. 
Pig Improvement Company (PIC) regional director Jürgen Kramer said over the past seven to eight years the number of outbreaks among feral swine and domestic pigs across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Russia had increased. But over the first nine months of 2022 the number of new cases declined.
“I think that the most important part from a learning experience is that Europe was able to eradicate the disease in several countries in a quick and timely manner, for example in the Czech Republic and in Belgium, over the last two to three years,” Kramer said.
A key factor is the control of the wild boar population. Kramer said in North America, there are several initiatives in place that include farmers, veterinarians, and hunters.

The Canadian folk legend turned cowboy storyteller has died at age 89.
His manager says the Victoria native died Thursday at his ranch near Longview, Alberta following a series of health complications.
Ian Tyson hitchhiked from Vancouver to Toronto in the 1950s, where he was swept up in the city’s burgeoning folk movement alongside Canuck legends including Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.
The singer-songwriter penned “Four Strong Winds” as one half of Ian & Sylvia.
The tune was covered by dozens of artists over the years, including Young and Johnny Cash.
Tyson moved back West after the pair divorced in 1975 and returned to ranch life, training horses and cowboying in Pincher Creek, Alberta.
He won numerous awards for his music, including an induction into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2019.

According to the Ministry of Finance, the level of indexation for provincial personal income tax will be 6.3 per cent in 2023, which the ministry said matches the average national inflation rate from October, 2021 to September, 2022.
“Indexation will result in Saskatchewan residents seeing $94.5 million in annual income tax savings,” the ministry said in a statement.
In 2023, the ministry said indexation will save an individual earning $25,000 an average of $125. For a family of four with a combined income of $75,000, the average savings will add up to $371, and if that family’s combined income is $100,000, the average savings will total $362, the ministry added.
Saskatchewan, the finance ministry said, boasts some of the lowest personal taxes in Canada, and exemptions introduced since 2007 have removed more than 112,000 people from the provincial income tax roll. A family of four now pays no provincial income tax on its first $56,550 of combined income, the ministry said, which compares well to 2007 when provincial income tax took a bite out of combined income over $26,150 for a family of four.
Finance Minister Donna Harpauer said Saskatchewan is expected to lead Canada in economic growth this year and next, and resource revenue has allowed the government to help with affordability while paying down debt.
“Our government recognizes that costs have risen due to inflation, and we are committed to taking steps to help keep life affordable for Saskatchewan people,” Harpauer said in a statement.

After a year of significant price increases on gas and food, there’s reason to believe it’s only going to get worse next year.
The main reasons appear to be the war in Ukraine, the annual carbon tax increase, and the continual rise of interest rates.
Kerry Peterson, a Shellbrook area farmer, told farmnewsNOW it’s hard to be optimistic with all these challenges.
“They’re going to be huge for farms and all Canadians, so 2023… I’m very apprehensive.” 
Bob Reid, who farms in the Smeaton area, believes the biggest challenge will be a reduction in fertilizer.
They replace the nutrients that crops would normally remove from the soil after they’ve been harvested. Without it, crops could potentially die.
“My oats, I’m getting 130 to 140 bushels per acre,” said Reid. “Right across the road, with no fertilizer, if they got 20 bushels, they’d be lucky.” 
Reid thinks it’s possible a fertilizer reduction could result in a 75 per cent drop in crops across the country. However, Fertilizer Canada believes farmers can overcome this challenge if everyone follows through with the 4R best management practices: right source, right rate, right time, and right place.
Meanwhile, Reid said if all the aforementioned challenges come to fruition, those who live paycheck to paycheck will be the ones hardest hit.
“I’ve been doing this since Moses was a boy, but you take a guy who just got a mortgage… it’s going to be a challenge, there are no two ways about it.”

Located at 4701 51 Street in the small town of 1,042, calls about the elevator being on fire came in just after 1 a.m., says Bentley Fire Chief Ian McLaren.
McLaren couldn’ts speak to the cause Friday, and there’s not yet any determination about whether the fire is suspicious or not.
“We’re not sure exactly when it started, but when we arrived on scene, it was well-involved on the top part and inside,” says McLaren. “Unfortunately, there wasn’t a lot we could do besides protect from exposure and make sure nothing else burned down.”
There were no injuries save from some potential frostbite, he says, as crews worked in the depth of a near -50 wind chill.
The cold, he notes, is not helpful, as breaks are necessary in short increments and it’s hard to get the water to go as far as usual.
A nearby shed, as well as as some electrical poles and lines sustained minor damage.
“This elevator was in a field mostly by itself,” he adds. “Our biggest concern was embers coming off it, but we got lucky with the wind direction which was blowing the embers into an unoccupied campground.”
McLaren says the structure, or what’s left of it, remains on fire and crews remain on scene attempting to extinguish it completely.
“We are asking community members to please conserve water usage as much as possible to support containment efforts,” says a statement from Bentley CAO Marc Fortais, who also calls the grain elevator ‘iconic.’
“The large fire has continued to utilize significant water volumes and we need your support to ensure that the Fire Department can continue its efforts without interruption. It is anticipated the fire will continue to burn for some time.”
McLaren did clarify that the fire is contained and there is minimal risk to the public.
Lacombe Fire Department was providing mutual aid.
Meantime, Bentley Mayor Greg Rathjen calls the loss a big one for the community.
“It was the centrepiece of Bentley. We have a car show there, a drive-in movie theatre where we play the movie off the wall; it’s irreplaceable,” he says.
“One of the things we did recently with the new traffic circle at Highways 12 and 20 was put up ‘Welcome’ and ‘Thanks for coming’ signs, and they all feature that grain elevator.”
Rathjen, the longtime minister at the church across the street from the grain elevator, was up all night and had coffee going for the shivering firefighters.
He says the grain elevator was one of few remaining across Canada, and was still functioning. Most recently, it was being used by Healthy Herds for seed cleaning.

Tammie Windsor is the lead for the Prairie Cougar Research Project at the USask College of Arts and Science.
Windsor is asking the public to share their observations of cougar evidence in the province. 
“I will be collecting reports for the duration of the project, or two and a half years,” Windsor said. “This can include recent and historical evidence of sightings, photos, videos, scat, tracks, injured or dead animals from cougar predation, and carcasses of cougars.” 
The project database is created from the information received in each report for geo-referencing onto a map. Windsor will use the information to analyze population distribution, abundance, habitat selection, and other ecological factors. 
Despite extensive research on cougars throughout North America, Saskatchewan cougars have received minimal attention due to an assumption of having few cats. An increase of reports from the public and accounts of GPS-collared cats travelling through the province suggests a larger population than originally suspected.
Windsor said the success of the project heavily relies on the public to report their observations. 
“This baseline study could serve as a jumping off point for more technical research once we know the location and abundance of cougars throughout the province,” Windsor said. “This project would link the research together from other provinces on how cougars are utilizing the landscape.” 
The Prairie Cougar Research Project is sponsored by the USask Department of Biology’s Animal Population Ecology Lab. The project supervisor is Dr. Philip McLoughlin. 
To report evidence of a cougar sighting within Saskatchewan, please contact Tammie Windsor at sk.cougars@usask.ca or 306-713-3639.

The event will run Friday, Jan. 13 and Saturday, Jan. 14 this year in Lloydminster. 
Grayden Kay, chairperson of the organizing committee, who sits on the board of directors with the agricultural association, said as part of the event people can expect to see a variety of bulls and heifers on display.
“The first event was a great success last year and we are excited to see this event grow more each year,” he said. “It’s certainly a highlight of our exhibition programming.” 
Kay is also a rancher himself, and farms just south of Lloydminster. His family produces about 75 head of Black Angus cattle and Simmentals altogether. He will be showing some of his cattle at the Cattleman’s Call event also. 
He said the show will be a good opportunity to help producers from the area and potential buyers network. 
“For me, I think it’s really important,” Kay said. “It’s a way to showcase your product, your sale bulls before the busy bull-sale season begins. It’s a great way to bring bull buyers and bull sellers together in the local area to showcase the products we have on offer.” 
New this year will be a special show for pen classifications, running Jan. 13. This will feature pens of two or three: purebred yearling bulls, and purebred two-year-old bulls; and pens of three: purebred heifers, and commercial heifers. 
Groups of two or three bulls will come into the ring for judging, and compete with the other pen of bulls. 
In addition, once again the event will also include the Halter Show to showcase purebred classes of yearling bulls, two-year-olds and mature bulls, and yearling heifers. This show will take place Jan. 14. 
“Those will all be in individual classes [classifications], competing against bulls of the same age,” Kay said. 
The Cattleman’s Call will also include an opportunity for people attending the event to get together and socialize a bit, as part of what’s called “The Bull Session Social” during the evening of Jan. 13. 
The gathering will take place in the barns and will also include complementary appetizers. 
Cattleman’s Call will also feature a trade show with a variety of industry stakeholders available, for example representatives from financial institutions, along with dealers of agricultural equipment and cattle products. 
“There will be a nice array of trade show booths to browse through,” Kay said. 
He describes the Cattleman’s Call as an opportunity to get away from the farm for a day or two, look at some bulls and make new connections. 
“[Buyers will] surely find some bulls to either purchase right there from guys exhibiting them or get more information about bull sales happening this spring. Then, attend those sales wherever they may be,” Kay added. 
Producers have until Jan. 5 if they still want to enter to take part in the event to show their animals. 
Kay wants to thank all the sponsors that are stepping up to help make the event possible again this year, as well as the exhibitors who signed up to take part, and all those planning to attend the event. 
“It takes all of those parties to make this happen,” he said. “We’re always grateful to have the support.”

Combining heat from microwaves and infrared energy, these lentils could have more value for consumers, food processors, ingredient manufacturers, and producers.
Processing red lentils with a specialized combination infrared microwave system, the USask research team was able to substantially improve how easily these lentils could be digested. 
USask doctoral student Mehdi Foroushani is the first author of the study published in the journal Food Chemistry Advances. 
“The process makes these macromolecules of starch and protein more accessible to enzymes in our bodies,” Foroushani said.
By tweaking the amount of moisture in the lentils, and the amounts of microwave and infrared energy, the research team was able to make more than 96 per cent of the starch and more than 85 per cent of the protein digestible.
In raw lentils, less than 69 per cent of starch is digestible and less than 80 percent of protein is digestible.
To better understand what happened at the molecular level and examine it in the finest detail possible, the research team analyzed the lentil samples using USask’s Canadian Light Source synchrotron.
USask doctoral student Tahereh Najib and study co-author said starch has a smooth surface.
“We make it kind of rough, so it’s more accessible by enzymes and the starch can be better broken down,” Najib said.
More than two million tonnes of lentils are produced on average each year in Canada, the world’s biggest producer, with the majority produced in Saskatchewan. Lentils are harvested, cleaned, and graded before packaging or further processing. 
Most are cooked and consumed as a whole grain, but a growing volume of lentils is dried and turned into a powder to isolate proteins from starches and used as a food additive.
USask College of Engineering researcher Dr. Venkatesh Meda is the principal investigator on the study. He said the process takes 200 per cent less drying time.
“The unique nature of this energy method is that there is no input of chemicals used for drying, there is no output in terms of release of greenhouse gases,” he said.
In microwaving, heat is generated from the center of the lentil and radiates outward while moisture and heat escape to the outside environment. 
Meda said by simultaneously roasting the surface of the lentils with infrared heat, the research team was able to increase the overall efficiency and better seal in the microwave heat.
“By having more plant-based alternative food ingredients in our diet, one can also reduce our environmental footprint by fulfilling our need for proteins from plant sources,” he said.
The ideal setting of lentil moisture, microwave energy intensity and infrared roasting depends largely on how the lentil flour will be used. 
Meda said modified lentil flour can be a great source of plant-based ingredients for dietary and nutritional needs, and kitchen and food processing operations.
“Lentil flour serves as an additive or substitution to our food system to not only make the food nutritious but also preserve its acceptable texture,” Meda said.
The USask-processed lentils have not yet been assessed or approved for official trials involving human or animal consumption, for which a commercial kitchen is required. 
The lentil flour tastes good, according to Meda. 
“At home we have been using it, and the aroma has improved to ‘acceptable,’ and not deteriorated compared to any other commercial variety,” he added. “We’re happy to report there is not much loss in any of the sensory qualities of colour, texture, and aroma.”
The lentil flour is processed in small 50 grams batches. The next steps in the research involve improving the flavour, scaling up to process larger amounts of lentils, applying the process to other legumes and oilseeds, and examining whether the technique could also improve seed quality for germination. 
The research was funded by the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture and the federal government’s Agriculture Development Fund.

ADAMA Canada is expanding its agronomy team.
The company is looking to have the new team of experts in place in various areas around the country by January in preparation for the next growing season. 
ADAMA Canada General Manager Cornie Thiessen said the technical sales agronomists will be tasked with providing advice on the company’s current selection of products.
“The last few years have been extremely challenging in the Canadian agricultural sector, but they have also given us a chance to demonstrate our value proposition to the market,” Thiessen said. “As part of a global company with facilities in dozens of countries, we have been able to introduce new products and to manage supply chains to ensure product delivery to Canadian customers.” 
Thiessen said the team members will also coordinate trials and product demonstrations, help develop informational materials for customers as well as advising the company on potential future products to develop for the Canadian market. 
The company has begun advertising for the new positions, which call for people with several years of experience as well as degrees in life sciences such as weed science or agronomy. 
Thiessen said they plan to have four agronomists in place early in the new year and may add more positions in the future.

Over the course of the week, roughly 120,000 attendees, which included 1,200 international guests from 63 countries, and around 10,000 school children attended the event.
CWA CEO, Shaun Kindopp said admission sales peaked on Friday and Saturday. He was pleased to see record-breaking conference attendance of 276 registered guests for the ninth Annual Indigenous Agriculture Summit, and 767 guests who attended the 10th Annual Grain Expo. 
“We are extremely pleased with the numbers we saw over the course of the week,” Kindopp said. “The entire week was remarkable for us; not only did we see record admission sales, but we hit record-breaking entertainment with three sell-out rodeo performances and a sold-out Saturday’s Party on the Dirt.”
For those unable to attend the show in person, CWA offered live-streaming services for its Brandt Centre events which saw approximately 10,000 users tuning in from across North America. 
CWA’s education program made a return and saw participation from approximately 10,000 urban and rural students from across Saskatchewan for a hands-on agriculture learning experience.
Kindopp said it was special to see the eyes of the youth light up when they walked through the barns.
“We truly value the educational component of Agribition and want to encourage younger generations to learn the importance of where their food comes from,” he said.
CWA President Kim Hextall said the international buyers returned in greater numbers, looking to connect with Canadian producers and source the best of the best.
“Agribition would not be what it is today without our international guests and partners; they are a critical component to CWA, and we know this is a relationship that will flourish for years to come,” Hextall said.
Cattle sale and genetic highlights included the sale of a bred Speckle Park cow to a buyer in Australia for $48,000, and a Limousin heifer sold to a Texas buyer for $40,000. The sale total for this year is sitting at $2.25 million, with additional international purchases still closing.
CWA had another successful year partnering with STARS Air Ambulance as their charity of choice. This year, all the funding support raised during Agribition was roughly $250,000. 
The 52nd edition of Agribition will be Nov. 20 to 25, 2023.

After several months on the run, four cows from a herd of runaway cattle were captured on Saturday night in St-Severe, Que.
The regional chapter of the Union des Producteurs Agricoles said the cows were transported back to their original farm on Sunday morning.
Specialists examined the cows after their capture and confirmed the animals were in good shape.
The union said weather conditions over the last few days prevented the entire herd from being captured, so another operation will take place soon to catch seven or eight animals that remain at large.
In July, a herd of about 20 cows jumped out of their field and had been on the lam ever since. All previous attempts at capturing them failed, including a valiant effort by a group of cowboys from nearby St-Tite, a town known for its annual western festival.
The union said over the last few days, various feeding points were set up in strategic locations along with fences and other devices that allowed the cows to finally be captured.

The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, provides private sector financing to developing countries. The loans differ from the billions that Ukraine has received in grants and other forms of no-strings-attached aid from donor nations, as they must be paid back.
Since Russia invaded in February, at least 5 million jobs have been lost, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy. The National Bank of Ukraine estimates that 11% of businesses had closed as of September and more than half were operating below capacity.
Loans to the country’s private sector will become more important in the coming years as Ukraine’s finance ministry copes with a widening budget deficit. In addition, grants and other foreign aid are not guaranteed, and Republicans in the U.S. Congress have signaled uncertain support for Ukraine when they take control of the House in January.
Getting private financing is difficult for countries facing war, floods, and other calamities.
“You’re looking at a level of risk that is just astounding,” said Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard University economist. Even before the war in Ukraine, corruption was rampant and Ukraine had difficulty getting investment.
With a war raging, Rogoff said, “how do you make a loan with any kind of investment knowing you may not be paid back.” He said that, for now, lenders “can make a loan for humanitarian reasons or we need to give them money.”
Ukrainian agribusiness expert Alex Lissitsa told the Ukrainian Weekly, an English-language news organization headquartered in the U.S., that some of the biggest threats to Ukrainian agriculture are related to financing. “We have problems with liquidity because we have problems with logistics in Ukraine,” he said last week.
Still, private aid will likely remain important for the rebuilding of the country, according to the “ Blueprint for the Reconstruction of Ukraine,” written by a group of prominent economists studying the impacts of the war, including Rogoff, Torbjörn Becker, Yuriy Gorodnichenko and Tymofiy Mylovanov.
Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics, told The Associated Press that “at some point debt sustainability will be an issue.”
Ukraine’s projected real GDP is expected to decline by 35%, due in large part to the Russian invasion, according to IMF data. And Ukraine’s finance minister told the AP this month that the damage caused by Russian missile attacks on civilian infrastructure would cost 0.5% of annual economic output next year, adding to the burden as Ukraine tries to cover a budget deficit equivalent to $38 billion.
The $2 billion IFC package includes up to $1 billion from its own account, with additional financing contingent on guarantees from donor governments.

It’s aimed at supporting the implementation of Project ASPIRE, which stands for Accelerating Sustainable Protein Impact and Results, that’ll provide stakeholders the opportunity to work collaboratively at industry-led roundtables.
These roundtables are planned to help advance sustainable protein production and processing in the province.
“The ASPIRE Hub is a tremendous example of protein industry stakeholders working together towards a strategic vision,” said Marie-Claude Bibeau, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. “Engaging the entire value-chain will improve competitiveness and long-term growth of Manitoba’s protein sector.”
The hub will be hosted by Canadian Manufacturers & Exporters. They plan on recruiting in the near future to help implement ASPIRE’s objectives.
“Since launching the Manitoba Protein Advantage Strategy in 2019, our government has continually supported the sustainable growth of the province’s protein industry, recognizing that positioning Manitoba as a global protein supplier of choice will benefit the profitability and competitiveness of local producers and processors and the provincial economy as a whole,” added Derek Johnson, Manitoba’s Minister of Agriculture.

Marie-Claude Bibeau, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, announced on Friday that around $1.2 million is being allocated through the fourth phase of the Local Food Infrastructure Fund (LFIF).
“Indigenous, remote, and Northern communities are particularly vulnerable because of the higher cost of living and other geographic, social, and economic factors,” said Bibeau. “With these challenges, it is more important than ever to support food systems in these communities in the long term.”
Nipawin’s Salvation Army is getting more than $125,000 for an electric oven and a food truck so they can cook meals and deliver them to homeless people and first responders at emergency events.
The Flying Dust First Nation, near Meadow Lake, is receiving over $390,000 for greenhouses and an industrial freeze dryer.
Peepeekisis Cree Nation, near the Town of Balcarres, will be purchasing a greenhouse and irrigation system, a tractor with attachments, a refrigerated trailer, and food processing equipment thanks to approximately $112,000 in funding. 
The Métis Nation of Saskatchewan will be using around $366,000 on chest freezers, meat processing equipment, a smokehouse, tractor and related equipment, fruit trees, a trailer, fencing, and water troughs.
Agency Chiefs Tribal Council in Spiritwood is getting nearly $190,000 to purchase compost drums, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, a reefer container, and kitchen processing equipment.
A total of 79 projects across the country are getting funding, up to $19.5 million, through the fourth phase of LFIF. Details on 19 of them haven’t been released at this time as the groups receiving the funds haven’t signed contribution agreements.
Out of the 60 officially approved, six are in Manitoba and 12 are in Alberta. Fifty-six of the projects are also Indigenous-led, making up over $15 million of the funding.

Prairies Economic Development Canada (PrairiesCan) will provide $506,800 to the Short Line Railway Marketing Program to increase awareness and understanding of the short line sector and promote industrial and value-added agriculture business development.
Association president Andrew Glastetter of Assiniboia, Sask. said the money will cover about 50 per cent of the funding needed for the project over a three-year period.
There are 26 short line railways in Western Canada; 13 in Saskatchewan, five each in BC and Manitoba, and three in Alberta. Short line railways are operated by municipalities, private business and co-ops who purchased abandoned CP and CN lines over the past 25 years. 
Glastetter said short lines provide a valuable service to rural areas.
“Short line railways, over the many years, have proven to be an important part of the overall supply chain in Western Canada,” Glastetter said. “We originate and terminate the first mile and last mile of many freight operations and 60,000 freight carloads per year.”
The funding will used to create a better understanding of how short lines can benefit shippers looking to set up or expand operations in the west, according to Glastetter.
“One thing the short lines have not been good at is ‘tooting their own horn’ to communicate and educate the public and potential shippers on how reliable we are, how much we can contribute to the environment, local employment and service and efficiency to get products to market,” he said.
Glastetter said because of its energy efficiency, short lines have been identified as an important ally in provincial carbon emissions reduction plans.
“Anytime you can move something by rail versus moving by heavy truck, whether it’s grain or crude oil, rail is three times more fuel efficient so there is less of a carbon footprint, less greenhouse gas emissions, less damage to the road network and less tax dollars for maintaining roads,” he said.
Some of the projects include creating a brand for the organization, website redevelopment for the Western Canadian Short Line Railway Association, business development and marketing capacity building workshops for participating short line railways, print and digital marketing campaigns, and stakeholder networking to promote business development in rural, short line rail-served communities.
The association represents Big Sky Rail, Battle River Rail, Oyen Regional Railway, Carlton Trail Railway, Great Sandhills Railway, Fife Lake Railway, Great Western Railway, Hudson Bay Railway, Last Mountain Rail, Long Creek Railroad, Red Coat Road and Rail, Southern Rail Cooperative, Stewart Southern Railway, Thunder Rail, Torch River Rail, Northern Lights Railway, Wheatland Rail, and 40 Mile Rail.

The annual event where people can go to host farms and see how they operate and, maybe, sample some goodies goes Aug. 19 and 20.
Open Farm Days CEO Tim Carson says there has already been what he calls ‘tremendous interest.’
“One of the great parts about being involved or registering now is the access to all of the education and training programs that we have available that run monthly right up until the end of June.”
Carson says potential hosts can learn things like marketing and risk management in this training. 
He adds there are many benefits that come from being a host. 
“The provincial-wide marketing of Open Farm Days is something no individual or organization would be able to take on. We do a full province-wide program as well as work in regional areas, specifically to ensure that there is traffic for those hosts.”
Carson says there were 115 host farms this year, still below pre-pandemic levels where the number was around 150.
“That said, 40 per cent of our hosts this year were brand new to the program, and had never been part of Open Farm Days before.”
“Really, it’s a testament to how this is truly an incubator opportunity for that small business, that agribusiness, that producer who would really like to connect to the consumer (at) a way to get involved at a very low cost.”
